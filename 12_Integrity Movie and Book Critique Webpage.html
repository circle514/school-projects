                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>Sonic The Hedgehog: A Reader's Response Criticism</b></div>
    Sonic the Hedgehog, a beloved and iconic character in the world of video games, has been dashing across screens since his debut in 1991. With a reputation for breakneck speed and a blue blur that has become synonymous with the Sega brand, Sonic has evolved over the years. The latest iteration, often dubbed the &quot;Sonic Renaissance,&quot; brought forth a live-action/CGI film adaptation in 2020. This critique will explore the film's merits, its shortcomings, and the enduring strengths of the Sonic franchise.

    &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (2020) successfully catapults the charismatic blue hedgehog into the real world, blending elements of comedy, action, and nostalgia. The film follows Sonic, voiced by Ben Schwartz, as he seeks refuge on Earth from his enemies. James Marsden plays the affable Tom Wachowski, a small-town sheriff who becomes Sonic's unlikely ally. The chemistry between Sonic and Tom provides the heart of the movie, adding emotional depth to the otherwise fast-paced adventure.
 
    The film's strongest aspect lies in its commitment to the source material. Sonic's character design, initially criticized in the film's first trailer, was later overhauled to better match the beloved video game character. This decision resonated well with fans and contributed to the film's overall success. The narrative, while formulaic, manages to strike a balance between humor, action, and genuine moments of connection.
 
    Jim Carrey's portrayal of the infamous Dr. Robotnik injects the film with energy and comedic brilliance. Carrey's over-the-top performance brings the classic video game antagonist to life in a way that both honors the character's essence and introduces him to a new generation of viewers.
 
    However, the film is not without its flaws. The plot adheres closely to the standard &quot;fish-out-of-water&quot; formula, and some scenes feel predictable. Additionally, while the CGI integration is generally well-executed, there are moments where Sonic's animated presence feels disconnected from the live-action surroundings.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>Thor: Love and Thunder</b></div>
                As an ardent enthusiast of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I had the immense joy of witnessing the eagerly awaited &quot;Thor: Love and Thunder.&quot; Helmed by the skilled Taika Waititi, this cinematic gem seamlessly weaves together action, humor, and poignant moments, holding the audience enthralled from beginning to end. This master piece explores the origin of Gorr, a tragic figure driven to vengeance against the gods after the death of his daughter. The narrative skillfully unfolds as Gorr's bitterness leads him to wield the powerful Necrosword, symbolizing his quest for the elimination of all gods. This gripping origin story establishes Gorr as a complex and formidable antagonist, adding depth to the cosmic conflict that unfolds. I am of the opinion that this movie imparts valuable insights into love, personal development, and the exploration of one's identity.

                As Thor embarks on his adventures with the Guardians of the Galaxy, the film delves into his internal struggles and desire for retirement. The unexpected distress calls involving Gorr thrust Thor back into action, highlighting the persistent threat posed by the vengeful antagonist. Thus, it unfolds a compelling and meticulously crafted plotline that keeps the audience at the edge of their seats throughout. The narrative takes a refreshing turn as Thor confronts his own insecurities and embarks on a journey of self-discovery. The examination of his vulnerabilities and the challenges he encounters introduces relatable and thought-provoking themes, setting this film apart from its forerunners.
                
                A standout feature of &quot;Thor: Love and Thunder&quot; is its exploration of love and redemption. The film delves deep into the intricacies of relationships, underscoring the potent role of love in healing and personal evolution. Jane Foster's subplot adds a poignant layer to the film as she battles stage IV cancer. Her journey to New Asgard, coupled with the unexpected reactivation of Mjølnir, transforms her into the Mighty Thor. The dynamic between Thor and Jane Foster exemplifies the transformative power of love, while Valkyrie's path toward self-acceptance and redemption adds emotional depth to the storyline. These themes offer valuable insights that can resonate with individuals, inspiring them to contemplate their own lives and relationships.
                
                Marvel films have consistently pushed the boundaries, and &quot;Thor: Love and Thunder&quot; elevates this standard. From breathtaking combat sequences to awe-inspiring cosmic vistas, the film showcases stunning visuals that transport the audience to a realm beyond imagination. The resolution of Thor: Love and Thunder brings closure to the characters' arcs, with Foster's sacrifice and Gorr's redemption adding emotional weight to the narrative. The film ends on a hopeful note as Thor takes on the responsibility of raising Gorr's daughter, emphasizing the themes of love and compassion.  The seamless fusion of CGI and practical effects enriches the overall cinematic experience, leaving spectators in awe of the breathtaking visuals unfolding on screen.
                
                &quot;Thor: Love and Thunder&quot; features an exceptional ensemble cast whose performances breathe life into the characters in an extraordinary manner. The film's exploration of characters, especially the nuanced portrayal of Gorr, elevates it beyond a typical superhero story. With its intricate plot, compelling character arcs, and breathtaking visuals, Thor: Love and Thunder cements its place as a standout entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Chris Hemsworth delivers a captivating rendition of Thor, imbuing the character's emotional journey with depth and nuance. Natalie Portman's reprisal of Jane Foster is equally remarkable, highlighting her versatility as an actress as she adeptly navigates the complexities of her character. The supporting cast, including Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie and Christian Bale as the antagonist, further contribute to the film's stellar ensemble.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>A Child's Journey Through Loss and Growth: A Critique of Mark Osborne's &quot;The Little Prince&quot;</b></div>
                Mark Osborne's 2015 film adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's beloved novella, &quot;The Little Prince,&quot; is a poignant and visually stunning journey through themes of loss, innocence, and the importance of human connection. While remaining faithful to the essence of the original story, Osborne's film offers a fresh perspective through its contemporary setting and innovative animation techniques, creating a cinematic experience that resonates with audiences of all ages (Desowitz 2015).

                The film's central character is a young girl, forced by her ambitious mother to conform to a rigid and materialistic world devoid of imagination (Debruge 2015). This starkly contrasts with her vibrant inner world, fueled by her love for &quot;The Little Prince&quot; and its message of prioritizing human connection over material possessions. Through the Little Prince's fantastical encounters on various planets, the film cleverly explores themes of loneliness, conformity, and the superficiality of adult life, echoing Saint-Exupéry's original intentions (Schillaci 2015).
                
                One of the film's strongest aspects is its stunning animation style. The combination of traditional hand-drawn animation and stop-motion sequences creates a unique visual aesthetic that perfectly captures the whimsical nature of the story (Debruge 2015). The contrast between the realistic world of the young girl and the fantastical world of the Little Prince further underscores the film's central theme of the importance of imagination and the dangers of losing touch with one's inner child (Schillaci 2015).
                
                The film's music, composed by Hans Zimmer and Richard Harvey, is another highlight. The score beautifully complements the animation and enhances the emotional impact of the narrative (Desowitz 2015). The use of recurring motifs and melancholic melodies effectively underscores the film's exploration of loss and grief, while also offering moments of hope and beauty.
                
                However, the film's attempt to modernize the story can sometimes feel jarring. The inclusion of contemporary elements, such as technology and pop culture references, may distract some viewers from the timeless message of the original work (Debruge 2015). Additionally, the film's ending, while emotionally satisfying, deviates slightly from the bittersweet conclusion of the novella, potentially leaving some fans disappointed (Schillaci 2015).
                
                Despite these minor criticisms, Mark Osborne's &quot;The Little Prince&quot; remains a captivating and thought-provoking film. It successfully reimagines Saint-Exupéry's classic tale for a contemporary audience while staying true to its core message about the importance of human connection and the preservation of childhood wonder. The film's beautiful animation, poignant story, and moving score create a memorable and emotionally resonant experience that is sure to resonate with viewers of all ages.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>&quot;Whisper of the Heart&quot;</b></div>
                Yoshifumi Kondo's &quot;Whisper of the Heart,&quot; a Studio Ghibli masterpiece, takes its audience on a poignant journey through adolescence, exploring themes of self-discovery, passion, and the pursuit of dreams. The film, which was released in 1995, deviates from the fantastical elements often associated with Studio Ghibli, opting for a more grounded narrative. While the film does an excellent job of capturing the essence of adolescent emotions, it is not without flaws.

                The story follows Shizuku Tsukishima, a teen who embarks on a journey of self-discovery after discovering an enigmatic antique cat figurine that captures her imagination. The plot is charming and realistic, but some viewers may find the pacing to be a little slow at times. The story wanders through Shizuku's daily activities, focusing on minor details that may tire out readers looking for a more engaging plot. However, the slow pacing allows you to connect with the characters and their journeys on a deeper level.
            
                The animation in &quot;Whisper of the Heart&quot; is visually stunning, as is to be expected from Studio Ghibli, with meticulously crafted backgrounds and expressive character designs. Every frame reflects the attention to detail, creating a lush and immersive world for the audience. However, some critics argue that, while the animation is beautiful, it lacks the fantastical elements found in other Ghibli films. The more grounded aesthetic of the film may leave some viewers yearning for the enchanting worlds found in classics such as &quot;Spirited Away&quot; or &quot;Howl's Moving Castle.&quot;
            
                The characters in &quot;Whisper of the Heart&quot; are portrayed with such authenticity and relatability that it shines, especially Shizuku, who goes through a deep process of self-discovery. A theme that many viewers can relate to is the film's emphasis on the value of following one's passions. Nonetheless, some critics contend that some supporting characters are shallow and don't have enough nuance to have an impact. Even though Shizuku's friends and family are endearing, they could be seen as one-dimensional characters that take focus away from possible subplots that could have improved the story as a whole.
            
                Furthermore, &quot;Whisper of the Heart&quot; is a moving exploration of adolescence and self-discovery that is distinguished by exceptional animation and a compelling protagonist. While there are flaws in the film, such as pacing issues and predictable plot elements, the film's strengths outweigh the flaws. The film succeeds in conveying a heartfelt message about the power of self-discovery and the pursuit of dreams, making it a worthy addition to Studio Ghibli's illustrious catalog.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>Bullet Train: A Thrilling Ride Through Suspense and Ethical Dilemmas</b></div>
                If you're in the mood for a decent thriller to pass the time, Bullet Train will get you where you want to go. Bullet Train is an ultra-violent action thriller that takes place on a bullet train speeding from Tokyo to Kyoto. Its characters are a touch abstract as well, and knowingly comic-bookish. The majority of the characters either carry grudges against one another or are the target of grudges and are attempting to avoid the repercussions of past acts. All of them are either paid killers or other violent people associated with the criminal world. Ladybug (played by Brad Pitt) plays a hitman who thinks he’s cursed with bad luck. The Prince (the role of Joey King), who assumes the persona of a naive schoolgirl but quickly reveals herself to be a cunning and ruthless person. Lemon and tangerine (played by Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson), After going from mission to mission and accruing a murder count, find themselves on the train guarding the briefcase and accompanying the wastrel son of a mob leader known as the White Death. Andrew Koji as &quot;The Father&quot; is out for vengeance because somebody pushed The Elder's (played by Hiroyuki Sanada) grandson off a department store roof, putting him in a coma. The plot initially seems goal-driven, revolving around the comatose grandson and the metal briefcase. And though the movie can be breathtaking and impressive, its quick and confusing phasing can be concerning.

                The movie can be very anticipating to many audiences as its fast phasing could bare information on what is happening. Despite the flashbacks, mostly referring to a character's backstory, is displayed throughout the movie, it can be confusing and hard to absorb as it is almost difficult to digest for a quick and thrilling movie. Character representation may also be highly problematic because of the &quot;it's all a lark&quot; humorous element, which leaves little emotional or intellectual legacy in the wake of a character's passing. Nevertheless, it seems to be trying to play both sides, telling us that &quot;this is all light and silly and none of it is of any consequence&quot; while simultaneously attempting to hit us over the head with a dramatic scene that makes us feel sorry for the characters. The movie’s comedy feature shines when it centers on a group of self-styled badasses who believe they are free agents but are actually solely passengers on a train that is moving quickly between stations and doesn't care about what each individual passenger wants. However, the &quot;it's all a lark&quot; humor and abstractness neutralize elements that may become ingrained in the viewer's memory. The cramped location really helps to stage the combat scenes, which are often meant to be funny as well as vicious and gory. In fact, it quite imitates the cut-off confrontation from &quot;Kill Bill,&quot; even down to the humorous conundrum of attempting to murder someone without going against the train's &quot;quiet car&quot; regulations. Though, despite all the crazy and confusing matters, the movie is both thrilling and splendid, especially in its cinematography. The film's numerous foreshadowings will compel you to closely follow the plot since one mistake may leave you ignorant of a great deal of what transpired, including the how and why of certain events. For a film that features both a peaceful and violent environment, the cinematography truly does a great job at defining the tone. The cinematography really sets the mood well for a movie that depicts violence yet also a calming setting.
                
                In conclusion, the movie can be very quick with its phasing and story writing that would sometimes lead to confusion over the reason why these very scenes are occurring. But overall, the colorful cast and high-speed action are almost enough to keep things going. It can bring us into a thrilling ride with all the transpiring scenes that depict both comedy and violence. Stated by Seitz, M. (2022), &quot;It's practically a Marvel superhero movie anyway, except that the characters can't come back to life after being killed off. The result might've been a delirious work of art, instead of a technically and logistically ambitious movie.&quot;

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>Passengers (2016)</b></div>
                The film &quot;Passengers&quot; made its debut at the Regency Village Theater in Los Angeles on December 14, 2016, and subsequently hit theaters across the United States on December 21, 2016, under the distribution of Columbia Pictures. Initial reviews offered a mixed reception, applauding the commendable performances by Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt, Thomas Newman's noteworthy musical score, and the film's striking visual style and high production values. However, criticism was directed towards its plot and character development. Despite the varying critiques, &quot;Passengers&quot; achieved significant commercial success, grossing a staggering $304 million globally. Notably, the film earned nominations in the categories of Best Original Score and Best Production Design at the 89th Academy Awards.

                &quot;Passengers,&quot; directed by Morten Tyldum, takes audiences on an aesthetically breathtaking and intense voyage across space. The film explores moral dilemmas that could leave viewers feeling conflicted, despite having a novel idea and great performances from its leads.The movie focuses throughout the spacecraft Avalon, where thousands of people are hibernating while traveling 120 years to a far-off colony planet. However, a malfunction in their hibernation pods causes two passengers, Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) and Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence), to awaken ninety years prematurely. With its intriguing blend of romance and science fiction, the opening setup effectively raises expectations for the difficulties that lie ahead.
                
                The film's main highlights are the captivating performances of Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt. They have a strong on-screen chemistry and effectively capture the psychological effects of loneliness as well as the growing bond between their characters. The story is made more complex by the supporting cast, which includes Michael Sheen as the android bartender Arthur. The second act of &quot;Passengers&quot; has pacing problems, the satory becomes a little boring. The film loses some of its initial momentum as it focuses too much on Jim and Aurora's developing relationship. However, Tyldum, a renowned director best known for &quot;The Imitation Game&quot;, once again demonstrates his skill as a director. A breathtakingly realistic and visually intriguing space setting is created by the production design, special effects, and cinematography. The interiors of the spacecraft are expertly designed, and the visual effects in the scenes where the spacecraft is in zero gravity are especially pounding.The central ethical dilemma of the movie turns into its weak point. Viewers' discussions about consent and morality have been ignited by a character's decision. The movie makes an effort to examine the effects of this choice, but it doesn't go far enough in examining the psychological and emotional consequences, which leaves the audience uneasy. This narrative choice adds depth to the storyline, forcing viewers to confront uncomfortable questions about consent and the consequences of loneliness in the vastness of space.
                
                The visual aspects of the movie are where Morten Tyldum's direction really emerges. Together, the special effects, cinematography, and production design provide a breathtaking visual representation of space travel. The weightless scenes and the Avalon's interiors demonstrate the film crew's technical mastery. It is impressive how much attention to detail went into creating a realistic and compelling space environment. Furthermore, an emotive background is provided by Thomas Newman's musical compositions, which heighten the emotional impact of significant scenes. The soundtrack enhances the whole cinematic experience by balancing the story without taking center stage.
                
                The visually stunning movie &quot;Passengers&quot; explores the human experience in the vastness of space. The main actors' performances and director Morten Tyldum's direction add to the film's attraction. But the moral dilemma at the center of the narrative might divide viewers, and the second act's pacing problems lessen the overall impact. Overall, &quot;Passengers&quot; is a provocative movie that poses significant issues regarding morality and the effects of our decisions. Even with its shortcomings, it's still an emotionally stirring and visually fascinating experience for those who are prepared to consider its complex moral issues.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>&quot;Coach Carter&quot;</b></div>
                Directed by Thomas Carter, Coach Carter is a sports drama film based on the true story of Ken Carter, a high school basketball coach who aims to transform not only his struggling team but also the lives of his players. While the film has been complimented for its inspirational narrativeand strong performances, it is not without its flaws.

                “Coach Carter” is undoubtedly a motivational film emphasizing the significance of discipline, responsibility, and academic excellence. The narrative goes beyond the typical sports movie trope by underlining the importance of education and character development. The character of Coach Carter serves as a symbol of mentorship, instilling values that extend beyond the basketball court. Strong Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal of Coach Carter is a standout element of the film. Jackson brings a commanding presence to the character, blending toughness with genuine concern for his player's well-being. The ensemble cast's chemistry adds authenticity to the team dynamics, contributing to the emotional resonance of the narrative. Coach Carter deserves commendation for tackling relevant social issues prevalent in inner-city communities, such as poverty and systemic challenges. The film sheds light on the broader context in which the characters exist, prompting discussions about race, education, and social inequality.
                
                However, the film does not escape the trappings of clichéd sports movie tropes. The underdog team facing adversity, the tough coach and the climactic victory are elements that have become staples of the genre. While these conventions can be effective in creating a satisfying narrative, &quot;Coach Carter&quot; risks predictability and a lack of originality. The movie's strength lies in Coach Carter's character, but it falls short in developing supporting characters. Many players on the team are reduced to one-dimensional stereotypes, lacking the depth needed for audiences to fully connect with their struggles and triumphs. A more nuanced approach to characterization could have elevated the film. &quot;Coach Carter&quot; takes liberties with historical facts, altering events for dramatic effect. While a creative license is expected in cinematic adaptations, the deviations from the true story may mislead viewers about the actual events that transpired. The film's commitment to storytelling sometimes compromises its fidelity to the real-life narrative.
                
                In conclusion, &quot;Coach Carter&quot; succeeds in delivering a powerful and inspirational message through strong performances and a compelling exploration of social issues. Despite its reliance on sports movie clichés, simplified characterizations, and historical inaccuracies, the film remains a compelling watch for those who appreciate stories of mentorship, resilience, and pursuing education against all odds. The film's impact lies in its ability to transcend the sports genre and deliver a broader commentary on the transformative power of mentorship and the importance of community support in overcoming challenges.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>&quot;Rush Hour&quot;</b></div>
                Rush Hour is a 90’s American buddy action comedy film directed by Brett Ratner, written by Jim Kouf and Ross LaManna, and directed by Jim Kouf. It stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker as a detective. When a Chinese diplomat's daughter is kidnapped in Los Angeles, he calls in Hong Kong Detective Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) to assist the FBI with the case. But the FBI doesn't want anything to do with Lee, and they dump him off on the LAPD, who assign wisecracking loudmouth Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) to watch over him. Although Lee and Carter can't stand each other, they choose to work together to solve the case on their own when they figure out they've been ditched by both the FBI and police. So the two of them decide to team up with each other and solve the investigation and find the kidnapper of the Chinese Diplomat’s daughter.

                Hong Kong, that last night of British rule. Detective Inspector Lee, a close friend of Consul Han Solon, prevents valuable pieces of Chinese history from being smuggled out of the country. Two years later, while Consul Han and his family are living in Los Angeles, Crime Lord Juntao exacts revenge by kidnapping his young daughter Soo Yung. Han does not trust the FBI and has Lee flown in from Hong Kong to help them. However, FBI officials do not want outside assistance and officially request assistance from the LAPD, who are relieved to be rid of Detective James Carter, a big-mouthed work-alone cop who simply cannot be cool enough. His mission is to keep Lee as  far away from trouble as possible. But Carter and Lee don't like being put aside in that way and start working the case on their own.
                
                The storyline is as silly as one might expect for a movie that doesn't want its viewers thinking too much about plot or characterization. It's designed as a framework for the action sequences, all of which are in dire need of an adrenaline . Chan plays Lee, a Hong Kong police inspector who has been brought to America to aid in a kidnapping investigation. Soo Yung, the daughter of the Chinese consul in the United States and one of Lee's former charges, is taken hostage by a gangster, who is demanding a $50 million ransom to return her alive. The FBI, led by the usual band of incompetents, doesn't appreciate Lee's involvement, so they recruit James Carter (Tucker), a LAPD cop, to "babysit" him during his time in America. Soon, Lee and Carter, who don't really get along, are trying to solve the crime on their own. Overall, Rush Hour has some problematic elements but being a 90’s comedy, it’s almost unavoidable. This movie works so well because of the star power and charisma of its two leads. Its action is fun and, overall, it’s a fun way to spend an hour and a half. Definitely worth watching.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>&quot;How To Train Your Dragon&quot;</b></div>
                &quot;How To Train Your Dragon&quot; holds a very special space in my heart as one of the first films I watched as a kid. The magical bond between Hiccup and Toothless captivated me as a child, and even now, the film's enchantment remains undiminished. It's a reminder of the enduring power of childhood memories and the impact they have on our perspectives. The movie continues to be a source of joy, evoking the same wonder and fascination that first captured my imagination. It's like a timeless journey back to the enchantment of my childhood.

                One of the things that makes this film so good is its soundtrack. The soundtrack in &quot;How To Train Your Dragon&quot; is nothing short of breathtaking. The soundtrack acts as an emotional controller, enhancing the storytelling and intensifying each emotion that takes place in every scene. Personally, the music really resonates with me, transporting me back to the innocence of childhood and magnifying the film's impact. The soundtrack of this film is one of the things that makes it very nostalgic for me.
                
                The friendship between Hiccup and Toothless is the heart of the film. Watching them go from enemies to inseparable buddies is as heartwarming as it gets. The bond between a boy and his dragon remains a timeless tale of loyalty, trust, and the transformative nature of friendship. The film reminds me of the enduring power of genuine connections, a lesson that continues to resonate regardless of how many times I've revisited the film. It's a reminder that true connections can overcome any hurdle, a lesson that never gets old no matter how many times I've seen it.
                
                Hiccup's personal journey from being a social outcast to a dragon whisperer is one of the film’s biggest highlights. His ability to earn the trust of dragons and, in turn, inspire his fellow Vikings to do the same, is a really valuable lesson in empathy and understanding. It's a story that showed me the challenges of growing up, emphasizing the importance of embracing differences and learning from one another. It really is wonderful to witness not only Hiccup's growth but also the positive impact it has on the community of Berk. This film not only showcases the importance of empathy and communication but also instills a valuable lesson in embracing differences.
                
                The film’s resolution, where Hiccup successfully unites dragons and the people of Berk, is a beautiful ending that will always touch my heart. It's not just a victory for the characters on screen; it's a timeless lesson in acceptance and unity that extends into the real world. Growing up watching this movie,gives me the reassurance that kindness and understanding have the power to overcome fear and prejudice. It taught me a lesson to always be kind to others to spread positive energy. It gives us hope that kindness has the power to unite people and bring forth change in a society filled with people having opposing ideals and beliefs.
                
                Reconnecting with &quot;How To Train Your Dragon&quot; isn't just a trip down memory lane; it's a journey back to a time when life was simpler, and the bond between a boy and his dragon filled the world with wonder. From the nostalgic soundtrack to the exploration of friendship and acceptance, the movie continues to resonate with me. As someone who loved the movie as a child, every time I rewatch this film feels like a nostalgic journey back to a time when the bond between a boy and his dragon was pure wonder. The film's magic endures, and the simple joy it brings is timeless. It's a reminder of the enchantment found in the innocence of childhood storytelling.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>A Formalist Critique of &quot;The Adam Project&quot;</b></div>
                “The Adam Project” is a science fiction film directed by Shawn Levy that emerges as a cinematic spectacle seamlessly blending science fiction with drama. The story follows a fighter pilot from a dystopian future named Adam Reed, played by Ryan Reynolds, who accidentally crash-lands in the past. There, he encounters his 12-year-old self, played by Walker Scobell, and the two embark on a mission to save the future. Released in 2022, the film takes audiences on a captivating journey through the space-time continuum as it explores narratives of adventure, family, loss, and second chances. It has a 6.7 out of 10 rating and ranks 1,303rd in audience popularity (IMDB).With impressive visual effects and a strong cast, including Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner, &quot;The Adam Project&quot; offers a thrilling and emotionally resonant cinematic experience. In this formalist critique, we will dissect the artistic intricacies that make &quot;The Adam Project&quot; a compelling and immersive cinematic experience.
                
                The cinematography in &quot;The Adam Project&quot; is a visual , showcasing director Shawn Levy’s meticulous attention to detail. The use of dynamic camera angles during action sequences creates a sense of urgency and engages the audience. Close-ups on characters' expressions are done very well and effectively convey emotions, with the camera acting as a storytelling tool. The film also utilizes the contrast of warm and cool color palettes to represent different timeline shifts, adding depth to the narrative. The film's visual style is heavily influenced by science fiction classics like &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and &quot;Star Wars.&quot; CGI effects are also employed in the film and are well edited compared to some MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) films and other science fiction films.
                
                The film's sound design plays a pivotal role in immersing the audience in its time-travel narrative. Rob Simonsen's score seamlessly blends orchestral and electronic elements, reflecting the film's nostalgic yet futuristic setting. The carefully curated musical score complements key moments, heightening the emotional impact. A concrete example of this can be found in the last act of the movie when young Adam and Louis decide to play baseball before young Adam fades into existence and returns to his respective timeline. The song arrangement in that respective scene really impacted the scene and helped convey the emotions that the director and writers wanted to convey. However, the film's sound design suffers from occasional imbalances in mixing, with dialogue clarity sometimes sacrificed for the sake of volume and competing sound effects. Overall, the sound design effectively supports the film's narrative and emotional impact but lacks the nuanced detail and innovation to reach its full potential.
                
                &quot;The Adam Project&quot; employs a non-linear narrative structure, jumping back and forth between different timelines. This forces viewers to engage actively with the plot as it can become quite confusing for audiences as they need to juggle between the different timelines and the consequences that come with jumping between timelines. This non-linear narrative structure also allows the film to build suspense and create a sense of mystery surrounding the characters' motivations and the true nature of their mission. The film masterfully utilizes time travel within its narrative, not just as a plot device but as a tool for exploring character development and thematic depth. This is very evident in Adam's journey through time as it allows him to confront past mistakes and reconcile with his younger self. The film relies heavily on several known and well-worn plot devices, such as time travel paradoxes like the Grandfather Paradox and the Bootstrap Paradox, and alternate timelines while at the same time effectively navigating the complexities of time travel, avoiding major inconsistencies and plot holes.
                
                &quot;The Adam Project&quot; features a compelling cast of characters, each with distinct personalities and motivations. Adam Reed, the protagonist, undergoes a significant transformation as he grapples with guilt and regret over his past choices. The 12-year-old version of Adam Reed also undergoes a character evolution as he goes from an arrogant, selfish, and inconsiderate child who treats his mother poorly to a thoughtful and loving son who appreciates all that he has, no matter how small. The film effectively portrays both of their emotional growth and ultimately ends up in a heartfelt reconciliation with Adam and his younger self. Supporting characters in the film also experience different character developments. Louis Reed, Adam’s father, though deceased, still becomes a vital and important character throughout the film and leaves a very huge mark on the audience’s heart even with the limited on-screen presence. The opposite can be said about supporting characters Laura Shane (Adam’s Future Wife) and the antagonist Maya Sorian, as they feel underdeveloped, leaving them with less depth and complexity.
                
                &quot;The Adam Project&quot; delves into a variety of themes that resonate deeply with the audience. The film explores the profound impact of loss and grief, particularly on young Adam, who struggles to cope with the sudden death of his father. Through this, the film effectively portrays the journey of healing and acceptance, emphasizing the importance of allowing oneself to grieve and find comfort in support networks. Another prominent theme is the power of family and the enduring strength of the bond between siblings. The film beautifully showcases the intricate relationship between Adam and his younger self, highlighting how their actions and choices influence one another across different timelines. This theme emphasizes the importance of family support and the lasting impact we have on each other, even across generations. Furthermore, the film explores the complexities of self-forgiveness and self-acceptance as Adam’s journey through time forces him to confront past mistakes and come to terms with his flawed self.
                
                In conclusion, &quot;The Adam Project&quot; is a captivating sci-fi film that combines stunning visuals, a compelling narrative, and strong emotional resonance. Levy's masterful direction, the film's effective use of time travel, and well-developed characters contribute to its overall success. While minor inconsistencies in sound design and underdeveloped supporting characters exist, &quot;The Adam Project&quot; delivers a thrilling and exciting cinematic experience. This film is a must-watch for fans of sci-fi, adventure, and heartwarming stories, leaving a lasting impact on viewers long after the credits roll. Overall, I would definitely recommend this film to kids and adults alike, and I am definitely looking forward to the sequel.

                The movie depicts a scene in the World War 2 that happened in Southern Okinawa, Japan. The movie depicts a person named Desmond Doss who is a true believer of Christianity and does not want to hold any gun. He also is against killing people as it is not allowed according to his religious morality. Desmond Doss has been deployed to the World War 2 as a medic. He helped countless soldiers wounded, tending then. He even helped a soldier that is opposed to him. Desmond Doss have been said that he saved 70+ people but it could have been more according to historians. 

                The movie itself has allot of meanings. I chose this movie as it shows a person on how he can achieve more than doing the literal thing to do, killing. As Desmond Doss is going on training, he never held a rifle. The instructor gets mad with his decision but he quickly justified that its for his Religious Morality. It depicts that you can win in different ways. Killing people isn’t only the option to win the war but to mend people is another thing too. But the idea of killing people or hurting people will erase the idea of medics. Desmond Doss also is a brave person. He goes in on No Man’s Land, then mending people who is in need of mending, and returning back to his base. He would also go every night, saving his fellow soldiers. 
          
                As the movie goes on, Desmond Doss and his comrades decided to go full in and went to the No Man’s Land, decimating every foes they see. Eventually the Japanese group “surrenders” but to a sudden surprise, It was a form of suicide by throwing grenades to the soldiers. Desmond tried to kick the grenade out, it went out of range for the other solders, but to his feet is another question. He was severely injured by the blast of the grenade. As Desmond is about to be carried out by a stretcher, he asked for his bible which he left on the field. He waited for his bible and eventually, the soldiers found it. He was then carried back to the base to be mended.
          
                I really like this movie since first of all, I am fond of military movies especially World War movies. But this sparks interest since it depicts a person’s bravery and resilience while also following his religious morality. The movie graphics, how it is very realistic also, is very nice.

    <div style='text-align: center;'><b>Interstellar: A Mass of Great Film.</b></div>
    
    In Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar,' audiences are treated to a cinematic journey of epic proportions, seamlessly blending amazing visuals, a captivating storyline, and a stirring musical score by Hans Zimmer. Written by Jonathan and Christopher Nolan, the film unfolds as a cosmic odyssey that shows the audiences what truly great science fiction looks like while delving into the emotions of the astronauts as they leave their families to search for a new home for humankind. The film starts off as Earth faces an existential crisis, plagued by a blight that threatens the world's crops and, consequently, humanity's survival. Joseph Cooper, portrayed by Matthew McConaughey, emerges as the reluctant hero chosen to lead a group of astronauts on a daring mission through a wormhole near Saturn. This wormhole, a mysterious and potentially life-saving gateway placed by an extraterrestrial intelligence, becomes the portal to undiscovered galaxies and a beacon of hope for a desperate Earth.

    As Cooper prepares to leave Earth, he is faced with a dilemma to stay and be with his children or go to space in search of a new home with the risk of never being able to see his children again. The way Christopher Nolan directs this is nothing short of awe-inspiring as he shows the audience the effects of this heart-wrenching decision on Cooper in a scene where after the effects of time-dilation, Cooper watches videos of his children growing up, graduating, getting married, losing a child, and knowing that he missed almost the entirety of his children’s lives because of his choice. This leads to a gut-wrenching scene where Cooper cries and breaks down. Christopher Nolan’s incredible directing and writing together with Jonathan Nolan paints this scene as one of the most emotionally hard-hitting scenes of the decade and Matthew McConaughey’s acting shines through and displays the emotions as clear as day, or in this case space. This scene is a beautiful summary of the film's overarching theme—an exploration of the sacrifices and consequences inherent in the pursuit of the greater good.
            
    One of the greatest scenes of this film is when Dr. Mann, one of the astronauts sent to the wormhole in a previous mission, betrays Cooper and his fellow astronaut Brand. This betrayal causes the destruction of part of the Endurance, the main ship used in the mission. With the Endurance now spinning uncontrollably and close to crashing down into a planet, Cooper has no choice but to dock his ship into the Endurance. This scene is undeniably the tensest scene in the movie with everything about the mission and the lives of Cooper and Brand on the line as it features the score of Hans Zimmer 'No Time for Caution.'
            
    While 'Interstellar' stands as a cinematic masterpiece, it is not without its flaws. One notable critique lies in the film's explanations of complex scientific concepts, which may pose challenges for some audiences. Theoretical physics, time dilation, and cosmic phenomena could potentially alienate viewers who are not well-versed in these subjects. Additionally, the film's writing, while captivating, can be perceived as convoluted, with some finding certain plot points overly intricate or difficult to follow. Furthermore, the film's emotional intensity, a strength in many aspects, may come across as overly sentimental for some viewers, particularly in its exploration of love transcending time and space.
            
    'Interstellar,' crafted by director Christopher Nolan, presents a cinematic experience that seamlessly merges breathtaking visuals, a captivating storyline, and a poignant musical score by Hans Zimmer. This cosmic journey unfolds against the backdrop of a world in crisis, as humanity grapples with existential challenges. Nolan's directorial finesse explores universal themes of sacrifice, the pursuit of a greater good, and the profound human emotions entwined with such endeavors. While the film navigates complex scientific concepts and emotional depths, it stands as a testament to Nolan's mastery, offering audiences a thought-provoking exploration of the boundless mysteries of space and the resilience of the human spirit.

                The final installment of the dystopian trilogy based on James Dashner's novels is &quot;Maze Runner: The Death Cure.&quot; The film, which debuted in 2018, takes myself  on an engrossing adventure through a post-apocalyptic world where the Flare virus has taken over. The film promises strong action, compelling storytelling, and emotional conclusions as it represents the climax of Thomas's search for answers. &quot;The Death Cure&quot; aims to please the devoted followers of the game while providing a fitting denouement to the maze-centric story with the Gladers' destiny in jeopardy.

The film's intense action keeps viewers on the edge of their seats as Thomas and his allies negotiate the perils of the WCKD-controlled world.

                 A notable aspect of the movie is the development of its main characters, especially Thomas. The characters' struggles with the fallout from their previous choices give the storyline additional emotional depth as it progresses.

The film's legacy as an unforgettable and captivating conclusion to the Maze Runner saga is largely due to Wes Ball's directing vision and the dedicated performances of the cast.

                &quot;Wish Dragon&quot; is a charming animated film that brings a fresh perspective to the classic tale of a genie granting wishes. Directed by Chris Appelhans and released in 2021, this delightful movie combines elements of fantasy, comedy, and heartwarming storytelling to create an enjoyable cinematic experience for audiences of all ages. Set against the backdrop of modern-day Shanghai, the movie follows the adventures of Din, a determined young man, and Long, a charismatic wish-granting dragon. This charming cinematic experience appeals to audiences of all ages, offering a fresh and enchanting perspective on the timeless concept of wishes coming true.

                The film follows the story of Din, a young man living in modern-day Shanghai who stumbles upon a magical teapot containing a wish-granting dragon named Long. Din, voiced by Jimmy Wong, dreams of reconnecting with Li Na, his childhood friend and crush, who has risen to a life of privilege and luxury. Long, portrayed by the charismatic John Cho, is a dragon with a penchant for humor and a complex backstory of his own. The dynamic between Din and Long forms the core of the movie's narrative, as they embark on an adventurous journey through the bustling streets of Shanghai to fulfill Din's heartfelt wish.
                
                One of the standout aspects of &quot;Wish Dragon&quot; is its stunning animation. The vibrant visuals and meticulous attention to detail bring the cityscape of Shanghai to life, immersing the audience in a bustling metropolis filled with color and energy. The character designs are expressive, and the animation beautifully captures the emotions of the characters, enhancing the storytelling and creating a visually engaging experience.
                
                Moreover, the film does a commendable job of blending humor with heartfelt moments. Long's witty one-liners and comedic antics add levity to the story, providing several laugh-out-loud moments for viewers. However, beneath the humor lies a deeper emotional core as the film explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and the true meaning of happiness. The relationship between Din and Long evolves throughout the movie, highlighting the importance of selflessness and understanding.
                
                Additionally, &quot;Wish Dragon&quot; distinguishes itself by infusing elements of Chinese culture into its narrative. From the depiction of traditional customs to the portrayal of familial values, the film pays homage to its cultural roots while maintaining a universal appeal. This inclusion not only enriches the storytelling but also offers audiences a glimpse into the richness of Chinese heritage.
                
                While &quot;Wish Dragon&quot; excels in many areas, some viewers might find the storyline predictable or reminiscent of other wish-fulfillment narratives. The film follows a familiar structure seen in similar tales, just like in the similar movie, &quot;Aladdin,&quot; which might lessen its impact for those seeking a more innovative plot. However, the movie's strong character development and endearing relationships help compensate for any lack of originality in the storyline.
                
                In conclusion, &quot;Wish Dragon&quot; is a delightful animated film that combines beautiful animation, humor, and heartfelt moments to deliver an entertaining and touching experience. Its universal themes of friendship, self-discovery, and the value of genuine connections resonate with audiences, making it a film that both children and adults can appreciate. With its cultural richness, engaging characters, and visually captivating storytelling, &quot;Wish Dragon&quot; is a charming addition to the realm of animated cinema. This is the type of movie that I would truly recommend to children and adults alike. I hope that the studio and writers can come up with an enticing sequel to further explore and continue the movie’s storyline.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>Parasite</b></div>
                Bong Joon-ho's Parasite goes beyond a dark comedy thriller; it is a searing indictment of class disparity and societal exploitation. This essay will analyze the film through the lens of Marxism, focusing on how it meticulously dissects the power dynamics between the wealthy Park family and the impoverished Kims, exposing the inherent flaws in a system that perpetuates economic inequality. The film establishes this stark contrast in living conditions right from the start. The opulent mansion of the Parks perched high above the city stands in stark contrast to the cramped, subterranean apartment where the Kims live. This visual disparity immediately highlights the vast economic gulf separating the two families. Despite their intelligence and resourcefulness, the Kims are forced to take on illegal and demeaning jobs to survive, struggling to secure even basic necessities.<br>
            
                The film explores the alienation and false consciousness experienced by the working class. The Kims' lack of recognition and respect highlights the dehumanizing effects of class inequality. Despite their struggles, they remain unaware of the true source of their oppression, allowing the system to exploit them further. The film cleverly uses metaphors to illustrate this exploitation. The Kims are figuratively parasites, feeding off the Parks' wealth and resources. However, the film also subverts this metaphor, revealing that it is the system itself that is parasitic, draining the lifeblood of the working class to sustain the unsustainable extravagance of the elite. However, Parasite's true power lies in its ability to evoke empathy and challenge our perspectives. We are forced to confront the uncomfortable reality of class privilege and the dehumanizing effects of poverty. The film doesn't offer simplistic solutions; instead, it compels us to question the very foundation of our society and the systems that perpetuate inequality.<br>
            
                In conclusion, Parasite offers a powerful and unsettling critique of class inequality through the lens of Marxist theory. The film expertly utilizes metaphors and symbolism to expose the exploitation, alienation, and false consciousness that are inherent in a society built upon economic disparity. By forcing viewers to confront the uncomfortable realities of class struggle, Parasite compels us to question the very foundations of our socioeconomic system and consider alternative possibilities for a more just and equitable world. Ultimately, Parasite's conclusion serves as a call to action. It compels us to confront the uncomfortable truths about class inequality and consider our own roles in perpetuating or challenging these structures. By sparking critical reflection and dialogue, Parasite offers a powerful tool for promoting social change, even if the path towards achieving it remains uncertain.

                The 2023 release of &quot;Barbie&quot; aims to revitalize the legendary ddoll's cinematic presence by fusing nostalgia with contemporary storytelling. Greta Gerwig's film, directed by her, introduces fans to a new era of Barbie with high aspirations. However, the success of this business is greatly dependent on its capacity to mix innovation with respect for the cultural value of the character.

                One of the film's strong points is its attempt to update Barbie. The plot, which revolves around them getting an opportunity to go to the real world and quickly discovering the delights and challenges of life among humans, aims to give Barbie character beyond her stereotypical image. However, the character development appears rushed and lacks the intricacy required to captivate adult audiences. The film's emphasis on Barbie's exterior alterations rather than her internal difficulties lessens its impact.
                
                &quot;Barbie&quot; distinguishes out visually thanks to its brilliant color palette and excellent CGI. With great attention to detail in set design and costume, the filmmakers successfully bring Barbie's world to life. However, the film's concentration on spectacular visuals occasionally overshadows the narrative's content. Younger people may be captivated by the fast-paced moments and stunning effects, but adult viewers will be left wanting more substance.
                
                &quot;Barbie&quot; stands out visually due to its vivid color palette and superb CGI. The filmmakers successfully bring Barbie's world to life by paying close attention to detail in set design and costuming. The film's emphasis on amazing sights, however, occasionally overshadows the narrative's message. Younger viewers may be drawn in by the fast-paced action and impressive effects, but adults will be left wanting more substance.
                
                Finally, the &quot;Barbie&quot; film from 2023 is a mixed bag of triumphs and squandered possibilities. While the endeavor to resurrect the legendary character for a new generation is admirable, the film falls short of delivering a story that speaks to people of all ages. Striking a balance between visual spectacle and serious storytelling remains difficult, so future Barbie adaptations must learn from both the positive and poor parts of this film.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>Shutter Island</b></div>
                &quot;Shutter Island,&quot; is directed by Martin Scorsese and based on Dennis Lehane's novel, that delves into the complexities of the human mind. Set in the 1950s, the film follows U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (played by Mark Ruffalo) as they investigate the mysterious disappearance of a patient from Ashecliffe Hospital, a psychiatric institution for the criminally insane located on Shutter Island.

                The cast’s outstanding performances and the film’s character development are its strongest point. The way that Leonardo DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels is captivating; he expertly conveys the characters inner problems and mental torment. His portrayal of a driven, tormented marshal dealing with personal pain is powerful and captivating. The picture gains depth from Mark Ruffalo’s nuanced portrayal of Chuck Aule, which further enhances DiCaprio’s character and creates an engaging interplay between the two stars.
                
                The spooky atmosphere of the movie is greatly enhanced by the eerie atmosphere of the remote island and the eerie photography. Scorsese creates a disquieting environment that totally immerses the audience in Teddy's confused and paranoid state of mind through the skillful use of dark, menacing imagery and a haunting soundscape. The tension in the story is increased by the photography, which does a good job of capturing the feeling of claustrophobia and foreboding.
                
                &quot;Shutter Island&quot; is a film that focuses on its psychological nuance and story twists. Using ambiguity and red herrings to keep viewers guessing until the big reveal, the movie deftly manipulates the audience's views. The narrative deftly traverses levels of illusion and reality, testing the audience's comprehension of what constitutes truth and deceit. Viewers are prompted to consider the nature of sanity and the subjective nature of reality as a result of the narrative's deep investigation of mental health, trauma, and the frailty of the human psyche.
                
                Although the film's ambiguity contributes to its mystique, some viewers might feel lost or cut off from the plot. While necessary for creating tension, the deliberate pacing and complex plot twists may seem excessively slow-paced or complicated to certain viewers. Although a stylistic decision, the purposeful ambiguity might turn off viewers who are looking for a clearer story.
                
                In conclusion, &quot;Shutter Island&quot; is a brilliantly written psychological thriller that enthralls viewers with its powerful acting, unsettling setting, and provocative story. The film's examination of mental anguish and the fuzziness of the boundaries between reality and perception is elevated by Martin Scorsese's direction and the outstanding performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and the supporting cast. The film's complex narrative and psychological depth make it an engaging and thought-provoking cinematic experience, even though its purposeful ambiguity and pacing may not speak to everyone.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>Movie Critique: Howl's Moving Castle</b></div>
                Almost the first sight we see in &quot;Howl's Moving Castle&quot; is the castle itself, which looks as if it were hammered together in shop class by wizards inspired by the lumbering, elephantine war machines in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back.&quot; The castle is an amazing visual invention, a vast collection of turrets and annexes, protuberances and afterthoughts, which makes its way across the landscape like a turtle in search of a rumble. I settled back in my seat, confident that Japan's Hayao Miyazaki had once again created his particular kind of animated magic, and that the movie would deserve comparison with &quot;Spirited Away,&quot; &quot;Princess Mononoke,&quot; &quot;My Neighbor Totoro,&quot; &quot;Kiki's Delivery Service&quot; and the other treasures of the most creative animator in the history of the art form. While the movie contains delights and inventions without pause and has undeniable charm, while it is always wonderful to watch, while it has the Miyazaki visual wonderment.

                The movie really sets the audiences amaze by the essential component of any visual artwork is colors that can serve both to express the mood of the characters and to create it in the viewers. As apparent from the given shots, Howl’s Moving Castle is not excessively bright, but also adds to realism. The latter is important because, although the animation tells a fictional story, the emphasis is on the character’s traits and behavior, through which both Jones and Miyazaki seek to transmit certain philosophic messages. Lines and shapes also determine the harmony of visual art by matching or not matching the colors. In Moving Castle, the lines are thin, and the shapes gentle, so that they supplement the delicate shades. The resulting combination enables drawing detail, such as the mimics of the characters and the decoration of their clothes, as in the image below. This not only strengthens the attachment to reality by specifying the setting epoch, but appeals to the viewer’s empathy by depicting emotions. Lines, shapes, and colors in the animation form a unity, which, in turn, comprises the detail that the moviemakers consider important. It is worth noting that, although the setting plays a considerable role in realistic perception, the emphasis is on people, specifically, on their emotional as well as behavioral response to the events. This is apparent from the scenes where the figures of the characters are especially sharp on the background of partly blurred landscapes, as in the following example. Such an approach to drawing proves that the main function of the animation is exploring the inner thought of various individuals and the ways in which they interact with each other and with the environment. The storyline is great since it set the mood and followed by the plot which makes everything more interesting.

                In conclusion Howl’s Moving Castle, Hayao Miyazaki’s adaptation of the novel by Diana Jones, highlights the actual closeness of the fictional story to reality by artistic means. Among those are such elements as lines, shapes, and colors, whose subtleness provides sufficient flexibility for depicting important detail to make the characters lifelike. In addition, the sharpness of the latter in comparison with the backgrounds attracts additional attention to their feelings and actions, making the audience empathize with them. Miyazaki's films require a conscious investment of attention; you have to immerse yourself in them, and soon you will find yourself floating, buoyed up by his gentleness, his visual exuberance, and his  intelligence and emotional literacy. It is a lovely film for all ages.

                The animation in the movie is amazing and the people are perfectly portrayed, the scenery is incredibly realistic, and the colors are vibrant. As Hiccup and Toothless glide through the skies and take part in exciting air battles, the flight scenes are particularly stunning. Both human and dragon characters have complexity and are enjoyable. Although Hiccup's growth is evident, the movie also has moving scenes that highlight the depth of emotion in Stoick and Valka's supporting parts. Hiccup's character develops complexity after the return of Valka, his mother who has been away for several years, and a moving examination of family dynamics is depicted. The animation is wonderful since it has vivid landscapes and stunningly detailed dragon designs. The aerial scenes showcasing the bond between Hiccup and Toothless are especially captivating, immersing the audience in a thrilling display of flight and freedom. However, the film is not without its flaws. The pacing is uneven at times, with some scenes feeling rushed while others drag on. Additionally, some of the secondary characters feel underdeveloped and one-dimensional. While the film excels in various aspects, some might argue that the pacing occasionally falters, especially in the middle act, where the narrative struggles to maintain a consistent rhythm. Additionally, certain plot elements might feel predictable to seasoned viewers, which might diminish the surprise factor for some audiences.
                
                To conclude, “How to Train Your Dragon 2” is a wonderful movie with outstanding works, with its great construction of the story about character development, grief, and resiliency. Its beautiful graphics, along with its diverse characters and moving narrative, make it a fascinating addition to the world of animated films. The movie is a worthy sequel to the original film, with stunning animation, engaging characters, and a thrilling story. It is a must-watch for fans of the first movie and anyone who enjoys a good adventure. Though it has some small issues, its capacity to execute strong feelings in addition to thrills confirms its status as a masterpiece that appeals to viewers of all ages.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>A Glimpse into Femininity and Time: A Literary Critique of &quot;Little Women&quot; (2019)</b></div>
                Greta Gerwig's 2019 adaptation of &quot;Little Women&quot; serves as a poignant exploration of womanhood, family dynamics, and societal expectations entrenched in 19th-century America. This cinematic rendition, based on Louisa May Alcott's timeless novel, masterfully interweaves narrative threads that transcend temporal boundaries, delivering a resonant experience for contemporary audiences. By skillfully employing various literary theories, the film offers a rich and nuanced portrayal of the March sisters. It frames their lives within the lenses of feminist theory, narrative theory, and more, setting the stage for a captivating exploration of enduring themes. Gerwig's directorial prowess breathes fresh life into the narrative, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in the complexities of the March sisters' world.

                At its core, &quot;Little Women&quot; offers a compelling feminist narrative, providing a profound insight into the lives of the four March sisters. Jo March, with her fervent desire for independence and a writing career, emerges as a central figure challenging traditional gender norms. According to Hajimirsadeghi (2022), the film becomes a captivating exploration of feminist theory, skillfully capturing the struggles faced by women in the 19th century. The narrative, while rooted in historical context, also serves as a relevant commentary on the persistent pursuit of gender equality in contemporary society. Gerwig's portrayal of Jo's journey not only illuminates historical challenges but also underscores the timeless relevance of the quest for female empowerment, resonating with audiences across different eras.
                
                Gerwig's deliberate choice of a non-linear narrative structure enhances the film's storytelling, infusing it with a nuanced complexity that resonates with themes of memory and reflection. This strategic decision aligns seamlessly with narrative theory, inviting the audience to actively engage with the characters' lives across different temporal dimensions. The film's skillful transitions between past and present intensify emotional connections, creating a profound engagement with the characters as they navigate the complexities of their evolving identities. This narrative approach not only enriches the viewer's experience but also mirrors the interconnected nature of personal histories, emphasizing that the echoes of the past reverberate into the present, shaping the characters' trajectories and the overall thematic resonance of the film. The non-linear structure thus becomes a poignant tool for conveying the intricacies of the March sisters' lives.
                
                A Marxist critique of &quot;Little Women&quot; unveils underlying class tensions and economic challenges experienced by the March family. Set against the backdrop of the Civil War era, the film starkly contrasts the dreams of the March sisters with the harsh socioeconomic realities of the time. This emphasis on wealth disparities and poverty serves as a potent lens for viewers to ponder the impact of economic structures on individual aspirations and societal expectations. &quot;Little Women&quot; thus emerges as a cinematic tapestry that weaves together the personal and the socio-economic with finesse. By exposing the economic constraints faced by the March family, the film prompts a critical examination of how systemic inequalities shape not only the characters' lives but also the broader societal landscape, making it a compelling commentary on the intersection of class and personal agency.
                
                One of the film's distinctive features lies in its invitation for viewer participation through the lens of reader-response theory. &quot;Little Women&quot; transcends traditional storytelling, transforming the audience into integral contributors to the narrative construction. The characters' choices and dilemmas serve as catalysts for diverse reactions, fostering robust discussions about personal experiences and varying perspectives. The film's deliberate inclusion of open-ended moments encourages viewers to reflect on their values and beliefs, elevating it beyond a mere cinematic experience to a dynamic and engaging communal dialogue. In doing so, Greta Gerwig empowers the audience not just as passive observers but as active participants in the ongoing conversation about the themes of the film and their broader implications in society.
                
                In addition to scholarly critiques, contemporary reviews offer further insights into Greta Gerwig's adaptation of &quot;Little Women&quot; (2019). A noteworthy article, titled &quot;Film Review: Greta Gerwig's 'Little Women' Shows Originality, Modernity,&quot; commends the movie for its distinctive qualities. The review praises the film's originality and modernity, acknowledging its success in capturing the spirit of Louisa May Alcott's novel while infusing it with a contemporary touch. Specifically, the article lauds the portrayal of the main character, Jo March, emphasizing how the film navigates the constraints imposed upon women by society. Additionally, it sheds light on the real-life drama behind the publication of &quot;Little Women,&quot; adding depth to the appreciation of the film's historical context. This positive review underscores the movie's ability to resonate with both classic literature enthusiasts and modern audiences, further contributing to the multifaceted nature of its reception.
                
                In conclusion, Greta Gerwig's adaptation of &quot;Little Women&quot; (2019) stands as a masterful cinematic achievement. By deftly incorporating various literary theories, including feminist exploration, narrative complexity, Marxist critique, and reader- response engagement, the film offers a rich and thought-provoking viewing experience. Seamlessly blending the old with the new, Gerwig breathes new life into the enduring themes of &quot;Little Women,&quot; making it a must-watch for enthusiasts of the novel and those seeking a compelling exploration of femininity and the passage of time on the big screen.

A Reader's Response Criticism
                </div>
                The Four Sisters and a Wedding is a movie that depicts a family of six with their mom and four big sisters, where their youngest, CJ Salazar, gets married within two weeks. With that, all of four CJ’s sister went home to understand more about the relationship of the couple and to know Cj’s fiancé better. As the plans for the wedding were abrupt and are in a fast pace, resulting in the discouragement and suspicions from the four sisters. As the family does their best to reconcile and solve all of their mistakes from the past and the present. They were able to fix the cracks that separates their family apart, heal the wounds that scarred them for years, and got back together stronger as a loving family. 

                The Salazar family has been full of cracks, problems, and mistakes that still haunts them to this day, but they have forgotten that the real purpose of them returning home is to know Cj’s fiancé and her family. Yet, all they were able to do in the dinner table is to argue, reprimand, and compare their and past’s mistakes to Cj’s decisions and current situation, which shows the willingness of the four sisters despite their flaws, will protect their youngest and his entire life. 
                
                While their very first encounter with Princess, Cj’s fiance and her family did not end well. The attitude, mannerisms, and the actions they did afterwards towards the Bayag family were disrespectful and offensive, even if they were only trying to protect their youngest, they should still show respect and proper conduct towards the Bayag family, despite the difference in their financial wealth. In other case, the Bayag family should also not have been disrespectful towards the Salazar family, despite the offenses done unto them, they should’ve not acted upon it and solve the issue without causing disrespect towards the Salazar family. 
                
                The entire movie portrayed the Salazar family in a way that despite their mistakes and differences, strive to understand each other, forgive each other, and accept the mistakes they have done and do better for in the end they are family.
                
                In conclusion, “The Four Sisters and a Wedding” is a movie that delivers the message of acceptance and love. Not just for oneself but also to others, especially one’s family. It also delivers the message that one must respect people no matter the financial wealth they possess, as they too have a story behind their actions and decisions in life, for we are all not perfect and in one way or another still makes mistakes no matter how much we grow for it is the very nature for us humans to make mistakes. But it is also natural for us to love, accept, forgive, understand, and show compassion to others for all of us are family no matter what background we have, we all are.

                &quot;Jumanji: The Next Level&quot; elevates storytelling by adopting a deconstructive approach, tells its story in a unique way, kind of like taking apart and rearranging pieces of a puzzle. Instead of sticking to the usual adventure and game rules, the movie shakes things up. It changes from the classic board game to a video game, surprising the audience and giving the Jumanji story a new twist. Inside the game, the characters become different versions of themselves, creating funny and thoughtful moments you wouldn't expect in a typical hero story. The movie even makes fun of itself, with characters joking about how weird their situations are. It also questions the usual video game rules, like lives and levels, making the whole adventure feel unique and playful. All these surprises and changes make &quot;Jumanji: The Next Level&quot; stand out in a fun and different way.

                &quot;Jumanji: The Next Level,&quot; directed by Jake Kasdan, takes audiences on a rollicking adventure, building upon the success of its predecessor, &quot;Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.&quot; While the film undeniably delivers an engaging and action-packed experience, a closer examination reveals areas where it falls short in achieving the narrative depth and emotional engagement that often distinguishes truly memorable cinematic experiences
                
                One of the most conspicuous elements of &quot;The Next Level&quot; is its departure from the original &quot;Jumanji&quot; concept. Shifting from a classic board game to a video game setting, the film introduces a dynamic environment filled with digital landscapes and challenges. While this modernization may resonate with a younger audience familiar with video games, it risks alienating those who cherished the magical and unpredictable nature of the original &quot;Jumanji&quot; as a board game. The film's choice to embrace video game mechanics alters the essence of the Jumanji world, raising questions about the necessity of such a departure.
                
                A critical component of any narrative is the development of its characters. &quot;The Next Level&quot; introduces new avatars played by Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan, adding a humorous twist as players navigate through the game. However, this comedic element often overshadows the potential for significant character growth. The constant switch between avatars becomes more of a gimmick than a meaningful exploration of the characters' inner struggles or personal evolution. This lack of substantive character development leaves the audience with an entertaining yet somewhat hollow experience.
                
                The film's prioritization of spectacle over substance is another area warranting examination. Visually appealing action sequences and well-executed humor are undeniably enjoyable, but the narrative tends to rely on formulaic plot devices. The predictable nature of the story diminishes the impact of its twists and turns, leaving audiences with a sense of familiarity rather than the awe that comes with innovative storytelling. As a result, &quot;The Next Level&quot; risks becoming a visually captivating yet forgettable entry in the cinematic landscape.
                
                &quot;Jumanji: The Next Level&quot; succeeds in providing entertainment through humor, action, and a novel video game premise. However, its departure from the original concept, limited character development, and reliance on formulaic elements contribute to a critique that questions its lasting impact in the realm of cinematic storytelling. As audiences continue to engage with this sequel, it remains to be seen whether the trade-offs made for modernization and humor will resonate in the long run, or if they will overshadow the potential for the deeper emotional and narrative resonance that viewers often seek in cinematic experiences.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>Moana</b></div>
                &quot;Moana,&quot; a Disney animated film released in 2016, has received praise for its departure from Disney princess narratives. The movie presents a perspective through its character, Moana, who challenges gender stereotypes and embarks on a heroic journey to save her people. However, upon examination of the film, we can identify both strengths and weaknesses in its portrayal of feminism, leading to a nuanced evaluation of its impact on gender representation in animated cinema.

	            One notable positive aspect of &quot;Moana&quot; is its portrayal of an independent protagonist. Moana breaks away from the mold of a Disney princess by focusing on her self-discovery and leadership qualities rather than solely relying on a romantic storyline. The film also emphasizes the empowerment of women through Moana's determination to overcome the challenges she faces throughout her quest. However, one potential drawback can be found in the character of Te Fiti. The central figure in Moana's journey is the goddess. Instead of portraying her as a character who needs to be saved, the narrative could have explored Te Fitis agency and her contribution to feminist themes more deeply.
 
	            Furthermore, future directors ought to concentrate on granting authority to the female characters that hold a pivotal position in the narrative, as this will enhance the portrayal of Te Fiti and reinforce the message in &quot;Moana.&quot; A more nuanced representation of Te Fiti would depict her as an active participant in determining the course of her world, which would be consistent with the overarching theme of empowerment. It would also be advantageous for the film to examine Moana and Te Fiti's relationship in a way that emphasizes a partnership built on perseverance and shared strength. With her departure from the damsel-in-distress cliché and her elevation as Te Fitis character, &quot;Moana&quot; has the chance to become a role model for animated movies that question gender norms, encourage inclusivity, and empower all of the characters.
 	
	            To strengthen the undertones in &quot;Moana,&quot; future animated movies could benefit from giving importance to supporting female characters showcasing a wider range of femininity. Moreover, the movie can delve deeper into Moana’s connection with nature and her people to highlight the significance of responsibility within feminism. By including a group of women in the process, both on screen and behind the scenes, animated storytelling can portray more authentic and multi-dimensional representations of women. This approach would amplify the impact of themes. Solidify the film as a progressive influence within its genre.

	            Ultimately, when it comes to &quot;Moana,&quot; Disney has taken a step forward in how it depicts characters. However, it's important for us to delve deeper into the nuances of its storyline. While Moana herself embodies strength and independence, there are areas where improvements can be made in the portrayal of supporting characters and the exploration of feminism. By addressing these aspects, future animated films can continue to build upon the groundwork laid by &quot;Moana&quot; and contribute further to the advancement of feminist storytelling within the realm of animation.

  <div style='text-align: center;'><b>A Critique Paper About The Movie &quot;Inside Out&quot;</b></div>

  The animated masterpiece &quot;Inside Out,&quot; directed by Pete Docter, takes audiences on a captivating journey through the mind of an 11-year-old girl named Riley. Released in 2015, the film employs a unique concept, presenting the anthropomorphic emotions—Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger—that guide Riley's actions. As an insightful exploration of human emotions, &quot;Inside Out&quot; not only entertains but also offers a valuable perspective on the significance of embracing all emotions.

  One of the film's strengths lies in its nuanced portrayal of emotions, creating characters that resonate with both children and adults. The main characters, the emotions themselves, undergo significant development throughout the story. Joy's realization that Sadness plays a crucial role in Riley's emotional landscape is a poignant moment that underscores the film's theme of embracing the complexity of feelings. This depth in character development elevates &quot;Inside Out&quot; beyond a typical animated film, making it relatable and thought-provoking for viewers of all ages.

  Visually, &quot;Inside Out&quot; excels in bringing the intricate workings of the mind to life. The vibrant and imaginative representation of different mental landscapes, from the Train of Thought to Abstract Thought, showcases the creative brilliance of Pixar Animation Studios. The seamless integration of storytelling and animation not only captivates the audience's attention but also serves as a metaphor for the intricacies of human emotion. This synergy between visual elements and narrative contributes to the film's lasting impact.

  Beyond its entertainment value, &quot;Inside Out&quot; contributes to emotional literacy by fostering conversations about feelings and mental well-being. The film serves as a tool for parents and educators to engage with children on the topic of emotions, helping them understand and express their feelings in a healthy manner. By personifying emotions and making them tangible, the movie becomes a valuable resource for emotional education, promoting self-awareness and empathy.

  In conclusion, &quot;Inside Out&quot; stands as a testament to the power of animated storytelling to convey complex emotions in an accessible and entertaining manner. Through its well-developed characters, visually stunning presentation, and contribution to emotional literacy, the film resonates with audiences on a profound level. &quot;Inside Out&quot; is more than a movie; it's a heartfelt exploration of the human experience, inviting viewers to embrace the full spectrum of emotions that shape our lives.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>Divergent</b></div>
                Divergent is a 2014 American dystopian science fiction action film directed by Neil Burger, based on the 2011 novel of the same name by Veronica Roth (Wikipedia contributors). The story occurs in a dystopian and post-apocalyptic Chicago, where people are divided into factions based on human virtues. Alongside people with different factions come the Divergents. Divergents belong to more than one faction and are seen as a threat to the idyllic society because their minds work in different ways, and they cannot be controlled. The film centers on the idea that whatever makes you different makes you dangerous.

                In a future Chicago divided by virtue-based factions, 16-year-old Tris Prior discovers she's Divergent, defying categorization. Drawn to the bravery of the Dauntless, she leaves Abnegation and faces brutal initiation. Amidst bullying and suspicion of Erudite's motives, Tris learns her mother and brother are also Divergent. Tragedy strikes as Erudite uses Dauntless to attack Abnegation, forcing Tris and her love, Tobias, to flee to Amity as Divergent rebels. While they fight for survival and Tris grapples with loss, Marcus's interest in the hard drive hints at further conflict. Their future remains uncertain, but their fight for freedom has just begun.
     
                I enjoyed watching the film because dystopian is one of my favorite genres. The first time I saw this movie, it met my expectations, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of watching it. However, as I watched it repeatedly, I noticed some things must be thoroughly elaborated in the film. There should have been more background stories about the apocalyptic war and the factions to fully understand why the Erudite faction wanted to start a war. Additionally, the serum given to the Dauntless people needs to be elaborated. It does not build suspense because it is introduced so suddenly, even if it is one of the critical areas of the plot. Furthermore, there was a need to create mystery and unpredictability in the movie's ending.
     
                The movie made me realize that no one can categorize humans into one thing. Our virtues might correlate to our actions and the life we ought to lead, but human beings cannot be reduced to one thing amidst its complexity. Certain things might be presented to us, like challenges and opportunities. However, our choices genuinely lead us to where we are now and where we will be in the future. In addition, the film was an eye-opener to the world we live in right now. Although we don't have established factions, society works the same way. Some are honest (Candor), people who are generous and selfless (Abnegation), who help those who live in poverty (factionless), people who are brave (Dauntless), and people who value teamwork and harmony (Amity). Belonging to one does not work because if that would be the case, we would be like robots. As people living in a society far from being idyllic, we must possess consciousness and strive to be the best of those many worlds, be true to ourselves, and embrace our individuality. 
     
                The film challenged my perspective because I usually think what is for me will find me. Although I still believe that is true, relying solely on fate does not do anyone good. Every day, we must make choices and face its consequences and outcomes. Furthermore, I agree and relate with one of the lead characters, Tobias &quot;Four&quot; Eaton, who said that he does not want only to be one thing. He wants to be brave and, at the same time, intelligent, truthful, generous, selfless, and a team player. I relate to his character because, as a growing person, I strive to be better than what I currently am. 
     
                In conclusion, this film is engaging, fun, and enjoyable. However, it needs more elaboration to build up the plot and make it more interesting, understandable, and unpredictable. I do not see the film come to reality in the real world, but it is an excellent metaphor for what is happening in our society. As individuals, we should strive not to be only one thing. We must embrace our natural gifts instead of hiding who we truly are.

                The film is entitled Five Feet Apart, directed by Justin Baldoni in his directorial debut and written by Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis. The film was inspired by Claire Wineland, who suffered from cystic fibrosis. Similar to John Green’s ‘The Fault in Our Stars’, Five Feet Apart by Rachael Lippincott is about two terminally ill teens that fall in love. Stella Grant is back in the hospital after a fever that would not go away and Will is in for a drug trial, hoping to eliminate the B Cepacia. Where Stella is control, Will is freedom. Stella has every minute of her day planned, she has lists. Will can not wait to turn eighteen to finally see the world beyond the hospital walls. Stella’s greatest wish is for new lungs up until she meets Will. He is dangerous to Stella as contact with him can get her off the transplant list. There must be six feet of separation at all times.

                As their connection started to develop, the risk between them also heightened as they did not pay attention to the rules of their disease. At the end, Stella’s greatest wish was granted, however it cost her Will’s life. The story ended with Stella living her life with the memory of Willthat lived in her. Stella Grant likes to be in control—even though her totally out of control lungs have sent her in and out of the hospital most of her life. Will Newman also has Cystic Fibrosis but recently contracted B Cepacia, an infection that has taken him off the transplant list. He is tired of hospitals and meds. He is what Stella needs to stay away from and yet she finds that she can not. Something about Will makes Stella embrace life fully for the first time. Rachael Lippincott, who played the role of Stella, delivers an intriguing, emotional, well-plotted and well-written read here with relatable and likeable characters that I couldn’t help but to fall in love with.
                
                The story is told in alternating perspectives between Stella and Will and I thoroughly enjoyed both narratives equally. They complimented each other so well and I really felt for them. Both of their situations and feelings towards each other rang true and I loved how I learned so much more about Cystic Fibrosis. As my emotions were at its peak upon watching the film, I have grasped the lesson it is trying to convey that even healthy young people can die. Illness can devastate families, emotionally and financially. It is scary to love someone and it can be even scarier to let someone love you, especially when you are embarrassed by your scars. 
                
                We all try to find a way to feel in control of something, whether it is by lining up pill boxes on a meds cart and doing what we are told or by putting an “Abandon all hope ye who enter here” sign on a hospital door and ignoring good advice. “We don’t have time for delicacy,” one character says, in their case because they may not live a “normal” lifespan. But in reality, films like this remind us we could all do better at making sure we get the most from the time we have. The film is rife with one tragedy after another, but for people who live with a condition that likely will not allow them to live past 30, it is not necessarily an exaggeration to highlight the uncertainty and fear these teens grapple with. Despite the film’s multiple layers of heart-wrenching elements, it also manages to capture the sassy, rebellious humor all teens can relate to.
                
                This film is an inspiration because it does not only show the realities of having to deal with such diseases, but it also taught me the love, sacrifice, security and risks that is a part of it too. It altered my perspective towards relationships that it is not just all about the feeling of excitement , there are alot more greater things beyond it and that we should be ready to take and handle those situations for growth and strength. There is no such thing as the end when you truly love each other, you just learn how to live by the memories you carry, even if it means it does not include their presence anymore. Overall, the film may fall victim to the cliches of many other young adult love stories — brooding bad boys, impossible love and way-too-profound and poetic lines to be coming out of the mouths of high schoolers — it is successful in evoking deep, real emotions.

                Ricky and Morty is a pretty cool show made by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, the show tells the stories of Rick Sanchez, a quirky scientist who loves his booze, and his innocent but kind-hearted grandson, Morty Smith. Even though a lot of people like the show, it still gets some criticism. What makes it special is that it makes you think while keeping things funny, a unique strength that makes the stories more interesting .Not every joke hits the bullseye, but there's a ton of humor to make up for the misses. The show explores some wild ideas, really digging into each one.

                The characters all have their quirks, but they stay likable. Even though things move pretty fast, you can easily follow the story and get hooked emotionally. They go into some darker stuff, perfect for people with a good sense of humor. They mix clever and funny moments with some really weird ones. The short episodes are a blast to watch. Sometimes they make fun of movies and shows funnily instead of just mentioning them. 
                
                But in some seasons, it gets kind of predictable and tired, losing some of its energy. The creative spark seems to fade like they've run out of fresh ideas. Characters lose their charm, especially Rick, who becomes more irritating. They ditch the cool mythological stuff for regular family drama, and it feels more like a corporate product than a passion project. They play it safe with the same old ideas, missing the creativity that made it popular in the first place. I'm having a hard time enjoying the new episodes. 
                
                They're just too confusing and messy, not like the clear and fun ones we used to get. It's like the show has changed and lost what made it great. The writers nowadays don't seem to understand the ideas and characters as well. The show takes a different direction after a while, with a big story connecting everything. But, for me, these stories don't fit together smoothly. It's like they're copying &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; where each episode feels like it was put together without a clear plan, maybe even by passing it around like a game of telephone.
                
                So, to wrap it up, &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; is a game-changer, shaking up what we thought animated TV could be. What makes it special is how it comes up with new stuff, talks about society, and develops its characters. But, like anything, it's not perfect. Sometimes it's all over the place, relies too much on shock, and struggles to make us really feel things. Balancing funny with serious is tough. As &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; keeps going, it keeps us interested and talking, making us wonder how it's going to shape the future of cartoons on TV.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>One of Miyazaki’s Underrated Masterpieces: A Critical Analysis of &quot;Kiki’s Delivery Service&quot;</b></div>
                Kiki's Delivery Service, an adventure, comedy, drama, fantasy, slice-of-life, and magical 1989 Japanese animated film, was inspired by the 1985 novel by Eiko Kadono. It was written and directed by Japanese animator, filmmaker, and manga artist Hayao Miyazaki, under the production companies Streamline Pictures and Studio Ghibli. Although not specifically mentioning a location or time, the enticing film takes place in a fictional town that has been inspired by Europe. This is evident in the town's detailed, medieval-style and modern architecture, beautiful landscapes such as its lush forests, and cultural references, all of which contribute to the nostalgic and endearing European atmosphere of the film. The clever use of detail, magical realism, weather, seasonal transition, warm and inviting colors, distinct and expressive characters, and, most importantly, an accurate portrayal of day-to-day life allow viewers to fully immerse themselves in Kiki's magical world and adventures. The use of sound and music in the movie begins with an upbeat and whimsical main theme that instantly establishes the tone for Kiki's journey. Variations of the theme are used throughout to capture various moods and movements, and a rich orchestral arrangement lends a timeless, classical quality to the soundtrack, adding to the magical atmosphere. Each character has a unique musical motif that reflects their personality, and folk-inspired melodies and rhythms are utilized. Lastly, is the seamless integration of the music with the animation, including the attention to sound design, that helps the world of the movie feel alive.

                As per the custom, witches are required to leave their hometown and spend a year in a new town to refine their abilities. The story opens with 13-year-old trainee witch Kiki leaving her home with her talking cat, Jiji. With her mother's broomstick in hand, she takes off for the port city of Koriko, where she struggles to adapt to city life. As she searches for a place to call home, Tombo, a nerdy boy who is fascinated with planes and finds her flying skills inspiring, follows her. She later met Osono, a woman who owns a bakery, Kiki helped her by using her flying ability, in return, she gave her a place to stay that opened doors for her to start a business using her abilities, a broomstick delivery service. During her first job, she befriended a sweet young artist named Ursula who lives in the middle of the forest while searching for the item that was entrusted by her customer but was lost due to an unexpected gust of wind in a forest. Kiki was able to win the villagers' respect and affection with each successful service. When Kiki accepts Tombo's invitation to a party, she becomes sick and is unable to attend because of work delays, exhaustion from the difficult work, rain, and moisture. After apologizing for missing the party, Tombo takes Kiki for a test flight on the flying machine he is working on. Just as he was about to take her to the dirigible, Kiki felt intimidated by his friends and decided to walk home. Osono secretly sets up Kiki's reunion with Tombo by having her receive a delivery addressed to him. She became depressed and realized she could no longer understand Jiji, who had made friends with a white cat named Lily. She also lost her ability to fly, which was a reflection of her struggles with growing up and self-doubt and led her to halt her delivery service. When Ursula unexpectedly pays her a visit and learns about her predicament, she takes her somewhere to take a break and gives her encouragement to reclaim her confidence and find her own path. After having a self-discovery moment, Kiki was able to reclaim her magical powers, support Tombo through a difficult time, and continue her delivery service, all of which demonstrated her development. The film ends with Kiki choosing to stay in Koriko after realizing that, despite being a part of magic, it is not the only thing that defines her. She strikes a balance between her magical identity and her developing sense of self.
                
                The story's primary characters are Kiki, Jiji, Ursula, Tombo, Osono and Fukuo, the bakery owners, the Madam from her second delivery service, and Kokiri and Okino, Kiki's parents. At the start of the story, Kiki is a youthful, optimistic witch who is determined to succeed. Following tradition, she leaves home at the age of 13 to live alone for a year. As a viewer, I respect her resolve to live freely and develop her talents, but I was concerned about her naivete and somewhat direct behavior, acting without giving things much thought. But despite her tenacity and fortitude, it reveals her humanity and vulnerability as she dealt with the challenges of living alone, launching her delivery service, and managing home sickness, which made her lose confidence. Kiki always has a talking, sassy cat named Jiji by her side, who also acts as a confidant and comic relief. He adjusted to his new situation and is still Kiki's devoted friend, despite their differing communication styles. Ursula, a free-spirited, artistic woman who embraces an unconventional lifestyle as an artist living in the country, ends up becoming one of Kiki's friends. She acted as a mentor figure, allowing Kiki to forge her own path, enjoying the journey and drawing inspiration from everyday experiences. Her persona gave the movie depth and aided in Kiki's creative and emotional development. Tombo is  a young boy full of energy and enthusiasm. He has a fascination with aviation and struggles to keep up with Kiki's magical abilities and fit in with her unique lifestyle. Together with her attentive and nurturing husband Fukuo, Osono, a kind and helpful woman, offered Kiki a room above her bakery. They became Kiki's surrogate family, giving her a secure and supportive environment. The madam, who Kiki met in a time of despair, offered her words of wisdom and a listening ear, and she has since been a wise and consoling presence in Kiki's life. Finally, Kokiri and Okino, Kiki's parents, represent the care and love of a family—an emotional bond and support that endures even in the face of physical separation. 
                
                The story's main conflicts are related to Kiki's loss of her magical abilities, which presented both a professional and personal challenge for her. Like starting any other business, running a delivery service requires independence, especially at a young age. Kiki faces challenges and doubt from prospective customers as well as competition from other delivery services. She faces the usual challenges of growing up and becoming independent, including loneliness, self-doubt, and discouraging moments, all of which she must get past to discover her calling in life. The dynamics of Kiki's relationships with the different characters in the town—Osono, the sweet baker who develops into a helpful friend, and Ursula, the mentor these relationships help her grow personally but also occasionally cause conflict and misunderstanding. As Kiki gains the ability to handle disappointment and persevere in the face of difficulties, dealing with failure becomes an increasingly important part of her journey. And finally, rediscovering magic, not only in the literal sense of magical abilities but also in the broader context of finding joy and meaning in life. Kiki's journey is not just about reclaiming her flying ability but about rediscovering her passion and enthusiasm for life.
                
                The 1989 Japanese animation film masterpiece Kiki's Delivery Service, directed by Hayao Miyazaki, is an underrated masterpiece. As Kiki sets out on a journey of independence, self-discovery, resilience, adaptability, finding one's purpose and uniqueness, stability and vulnerability, embracing life's joys, overcoming setbacks and fears, and, most importantly, rediscovering the magic in life, the film invites viewers to immerse themselves in the world of magic and adventures. It is a comforting reassurance that there is always room for failure and improvement, that one could always try again or take a break until they could eventually achieve what they wanted to achieve, that everyone is susceptible to difficulties and shortcomings. It also serves as a reminder that failing to meet certain expectations does not mean that one is less valuable. And that the road to becoming independent and discovering one's purpose was never easy, this is why it's critical to have a strong will and a network of people who are always there to catch you when you fall.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>We Can Be Heroes</b></div>
                &quot;We Can Be Heroes,&quot; directed by Robert Rodriguez and released in 2020, boldly enters the realm of family-friendly superhero cinema. This critique paper delves into various facets of the film, scrutinizing its storytelling approach, character dynamics, and the broader implications it holds for the genre of children's superhero movies. 

                At its core, &quot;We Can Be Heroes&quot; navigates the delicate balance required in family-oriented superhero films, catering to both younger audiences and adults. The film's straightforward narrative structure is finely tuned for accessibility to children. However, it's argued that the pacing, while engaging for the younger demographic, may lack the depth and complexity needed to equally captivate adult viewers. Striking this balance becomes a central challenge for the genre, influencing the film's overall effectiveness in appealing across age groups.
                
                A standout feature of &quot;We Can Be Heroes&quot; is its commendable inclusivity and representation, showcasing a diverse cast of young superheroes with unique abilities. The film introduces characters from various cultural backgrounds, contributing to a rich tapestry of diversity. Yet, critics point out potential stereotypical portrayals, emphasizing the need for more nuanced character depictions even in family-oriented films. This dual narrative of inclusivity and potential stereotyping underscores the film's impact on shaping perceptions within its intended audience. 
                
                The visual effects and production design play a pivotal role in creating the film's vibrant and fantastical atmosphere. The creative depiction of superhero powers and colorful aesthetics caters to the vivid imagination of the target audience. Nonetheless, scrutiny arises as some critics note moments where the CGI feels overly polished, possibly distancing the film from a more grounded, tangible feel. This tension between visual spectacle and realism raises questions about the overall immersive experience the film aims to provide. 
                
                &quot;We Can Be Heroes&quot; injects humor designed to resonate with both children and adults, adding moments of levity to the superhero narrative. However, opinions vary on the effectiveness of the humor, with debates about whether certain jokes rely too heavily on slapstick, potentially missing opportunities for more sophisticated and universally appealing humor. This aspect of humor becomes a critical point in assessing the film's ability to engage diverse age groups simultaneously. 
                
                In conclusion, &quot;We Can Be Heroes&quot; emerges as a noteworthy addition to the evolving landscape of family-friendly superhero cinema. Its commendable efforts in storytelling accessibility and diverse character representations contribute to its success in capturing the attention of its primary audience. However, critical discussions persist around nuanced character development, the effectiveness of humor, and the ongoing challenge of balancing engagement between children and adults. As the genre continues to expand, films like &quot;We Can Be Heroes&quot; stimulate vital conversations about evolving expectations and possibilities within the realm of children's superhero entertainment.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief</b></div>
                Percy Jackson is a fictional character and the protagonist of the &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians&quot; series, a popular young adult fantasy book series written by American author Rick Riordan. The series consists of five books: &quot;The Lightning Thief,&quot; &quot;The Sea of Monsters,&quot; &quot;The Titan's Curse,&quot; &quot;The Battle of the Labyrinth,&quot; and &quot;The Last Olympian.&quot; Percy Jackson is a demigod, meaning he is the offspring of a mortal and one of the Greek gods. In Percy's case, he is the son of Poseidon, the god of the sea. As a demigod, Percy possesses unique abilities and powers related to his divine parentage. Throughout the series, Percy discovers more about his heritage and is thrust into the world of Greek mythology, encountering various gods, monsters, and other mythical creatures. &quot;The Lightning Thief,&quot; the first book in the series, follows Percy's journey as he embarks on a quest to prevent a war among the gods and to clear his name of a theft he did not commit. As the series progresses, Percy faces numerous challenges and battles, forming friendships with other demigods, such as Annabeth Chase and Grover Underwood, as they confront the forces of darkness threatening the world. Percy Jackson's character is known for his wit, courage, and loyalty to his friends. The series has gained widespread popularity for its modern take on ancient Greek mythology, engaging storytelling, and relatable characters. In addition to the original series, there are spin-off series, including &quot;The Heroes of Olympus&quot; and &quot;The Trials of Apollo,&quot; expanding on the world and characters introduced in the Percy Jackson universe. The success of the books has also led to film adaptations and other media adaptations, contributing to Percy Jackson's enduring cultural impact.

                Percy Jackson is described as a teenager with dark hair and green eyes. Throughout the series, he is portrayed as having an athletic build, reflective of his demigod heritage. As the son of Poseidon, the god of the sea, Percy has a strong connection to water and often finds solace and power near bodies of water. He typically wears casual clothing suitable for his adventures, such as t-shirts and jeans.
                
                In terms of personality, Percy is characterized by his sense of humor, loyalty, and bravery. He often uses sarcasm and wit as a defense mechanism in challenging situations. Despite facing numerous dangers and responsibilities as a demigod, Percy remains dedicated to his friends and the greater cause of preserving the world from the conflicts among the gods. Percy's journey throughout the series is marked by personal growth and the development of his powers. As a child of Poseidon, he has control over water, the ability to communicate with sea creatures, and other related powers. Over the course of his adventures, Percy hones these abilities and learns to navigate the complexities of the Greek mythological world. It's important to note that the details of Percy Jackson's appearance and personality are primarily drawn from the book series written by Rick Riordan, and different adaptations may portray the character with some variations.
                
                The &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians&quot; series concluded with the fifth book, &quot;The Last Olympian.&quot; In the conclusion of the series, Percy Jackson faces the culmination of the conflict between the Olympian gods and the Titans, with the fate of Mount Olympus and the entire world hanging in the balance. Without delving into specific plot details to avoid spoilers, &quot;The Last Olympian&quot; provides a satisfying resolution to the overarching storyline of the series. Percy and his friends face significant challenges, and the narrative explores themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the responsibilities that come with being a demigod. The book also touches on Percy's growth as a character and the impact of his experiences on his understanding of himself and his place in the world. It's worth noting that Rick Riordan has continued to expand on the Percy Jackson universe with subsequent series, such as &quot;The Heroes of Olympus&quot; and &quot;The Trials of Apollo,&quot; as well as additional companion books. These series explore new characters, challenges, and mythological elements within the same universe. The conclusion of the original series serves as a milestone, but the broader world and adventures within the Percy Jackson universe continue to unfold in subsequent works. For the most up-to-date information on Percy Jackson and related series, it's recommended to check the latest publications and announcements by Rick Riordan or the official channels associated with the Percy Jackson franchise.

            Music, a beautiful array of melodies put together by people through utilizing vocals and instruments. Rhythm and harmony is something that cannot be avoided, it is often heard in bustling streets, malls, and even inside the comfort of your own home. Music influences the body and mind, it takes people to their own comfort zones where they have the ability to express themselves and be comfortable in their own thoughts while finding peace within the body. One cannot go without conflict over the course of their life, so it is only rational to find effective techniques that help with focus, health and memory. Listening to music is the usual approach a person might take in order to achieve serenity when experiencing any rough patch throughout their lifetime.

            Soul, an animated Pixar film created in 2020 conveys a middle aged man named Joe Gardner persistently attempting to secure opportunities in maintaining a music career perpetually faltering throughout constant rejection and disapproval from numerous musicians. One day, Joe received a call from a former student informing him that they fell short of one member in a musical band and offered Joe to play with them, he additionally mentioned that a famous musician named Dorothea Williams was also in the band, a musician Joe idolized immensely. He did not think twice and took the offer immediately, Joe portrayed an arrogant and careless personality as he was strolling the streets of New York displaying constant hazard to those nearby wherever he traveled since Joe neglected his own safety he ultimately found himself  falling into a manhole and essentially falling into a coma and departed from his physical body.
           
            While in the afterlife, Joe Gardner, is met with the gateway to heaven, relentlessly he tries to avoid the bright lights as he is not ready to die just yet. He successfully escapes into another realm deemed The Great Before, this marks the point where newborn souls find their personalities, interests and purpose of life before going to Earth. As someone who was not intended to be dead or alive, he took the identity of another soul and pretended to be a mentor for young souls who have yet to find their purpose. While taking on the identity of a clinical psychologist, he was assigned to mentor soul number 22, a spirit who has been stuck in The Great Before for over a thousand years. 22 had a rude and selfish attitude towards everyone, she despised earth and never wanted to live there as she could never grasp the idea of living only to end up dying in the end. Joe turned her perspective around as both of them were able to go to earth, yet there was a big problem. 22 was in Joe’s body, it rendered difficult for one another to understand and how to do things coordinately, although in the end it was all figured out and Joe was able to come back to Earth and live a life cherishing every moment as he helped 22 find her purpose and spark.
           
            Soul is a beautifully animated film which skillfully represents the mood of each character through its dynamic color palette choices. The flow of the movie and the way the audience can connect with the animated character makes the experience of watching this movie even greater. The movie is well paced, and doesn’t compact everything together, making it easier for the audience to understand the movie clearly. Although, I do wish that more of the characters were expounded on and explained more thoroughly so we could get to know who they are and what their relationship with the main character is. Furthermore, a more in-depth exploration of the supporting cast would have undoubtedly added layers to the storytelling, creating a more immersive narrative experience.
           
            In conclusion, &quot;Soul&quot; is about accepting who you are and discovering your genuine self. It is never too late to begin establishing your own life's purpose. Although life may not always seem fair, that doesn't mean you should give up easily. Soul illustrates that you can complete any task given to you with a little faith and patience if you have a purpose and a passion for it. The story relates to the difficulties of surviving in what appears to be a cruel world, but it also strongly advises not giving up too soon. Rather, &quot;Soul&quot; implies that people are determined enough to overcome whatever challenge life throws at them when they have a strong sense of purpose and passion. The film asserts that every work becomes attainable with determination and a firm belief in oneself, and it inspires viewers to pursue life's challenges with faith and perseverance through its heartening storyline.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>Flipped (2010)</b></div>
                In the idyllic suburban landscape of the 1960s, where innocence thrives amidst the reality check of life, the movie 'Flipped' tells a story about a tender tale of first love, narrated through contrasting perspectives between two teenagers, Juli Baker, and Bryce Loski, throughout their childhood to teenage adulthood. &quot;Flipped&quot; is a coming-of-age romantic drama film directed by Rob Reiner, based on the novel of the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen. It was released on August 6, 2010, and was set in 1957-1963, while the novel takes place from 1994-2000. As the narrative unfolds, &quot;Flipped&quot; beautifully depicts the hardships of adolescence, family problems, and the impact of first love. The film explores themes of understanding, empathy, and the realization that appearances should not be the basis of how one should treat people. Hence, this paper aims to assess the coherence of the storyline, including the characters' development, the themes and how they affect the movie's impact, the positive and critical aspects of the cinematography, and how the creative style of storytelling makes the plot captivating.

                Although often overlooked upon its 2010 release, 'Flipped' resiliently offers comfort and a reassuring sense of familiarity to its viewers until today. It beautifully explores character development, skillfully put into the narrative as we follow the formative years of the protagonists Juli Baker, portrayed by Madeline Carroll, and Bryce Loski, played by Callan McAuliffe. Juli is an optimistic and free-spirited girl who has had a crush on Bryce ever since she first moved into the suburban neighborhood. However, Bryce initially sees Juli as an annoyance, but his perception of her begins to change as they face the challenges of growing up. The characters showcase many romantic tropes from a childhood crush’s unrequited love, to asymmetrical affection, wherein Bryce Loski fell harder in love with Juli Baker. It excels in portraying authentic and relatable character arcs, which is not only applicable to the main characters but also to the side characters such as their family members. The suburban environment played a role in shaping the characters and providing context among the audience about the vast differences between Juli and Bryce’s economic upbringing, as Juli grew up in a less-fortunate but loving family while Bryce grew up in a well-off but dysfunctional family. While the movie centers around their love story, it also shows individual growth between Juli and Bryce, showcasing personal development beyond the confines of their relationship, which conveys a beautiful message for young audiences that growth is an ongoing journey that extends beyond love.
            
                The film explores numerous themes, and a comprehensive analysis is needed to fully grasp and appreciate the messages the plot wants to convey. The most prominent theme is the innocence of first love during the characters’ formative years, it captures the awkwardness, excitement, and challenges of adolescent romance. It also delves into the perspectives of both characters as the movie switches between Juli and Bryce’s perceptions of the world. Another theme is family dynamics and the importance of parental influence in the upbringing of a child. It also highlights the importance of effective communication and understanding in relationships as misinterpretations and assumptions can shape interactions. Additionally, the movie subverts traditional romantic tropes, challenging clichés with coming-of-age love stories, which makes it refreshing to watch. Through its cinematography, the film successfully manages to bring out nostalgia from viewers of various age ranges, making the story relatable to a vast audience. Lastly, it encourages empathy and the understanding of differences by emphasizing that appearances can be deceiving. &quot;Flipped&quot; connects these themes, creating a narrative that goes beyond a simple love story, offering an array of emotions and life lessons.
            
                Director Rob Reiner employs a storytelling technique that involves presenting both main characters' perspectives on the same events. This narrative approach is often referred to as &quot;dual perspectives&quot; or &quot;dual storytelling.&quot; This technique involves intertwining the perspectives of the two main characters, wherein it shows how each character interprets and experiences key events in their lives. This dual perspective not only adds depth to Juli and Bryce but also contributes to displaying the realization of their love for each other despite their issues and differences. By presenting both sides of the story, the audience gains insight into Juli and Bryce’s thoughts, emotions, and motivations. This approach can create a more engaging experience, as viewers can piece together the complete narrative of the plot from the monologue of the two main characters.
            
                While the movie undoubtedly has its strengths, it also has its flaws and limitations. A thorough examination of these critical aspects is important as it helps in an unbiased critical evaluation. One of these drawbacks is its clichéd sentimentality since some viewers might find it too predictable or “cringe-y,” as it might not be their preference. There are also pacing issues present in the movie wherein some parts of the film feel unnecessarily slow or stretched, which affects the overall rhythm and can impact the viewer's engagement with the narrative. The movie also contains audience bias as the target audience is teenagers or young girls, giving less thought to the male interest, thus why everyone cannot fully immerse themselves into the story. Ultimately, it contains predictability even in their attempt to subvert common romantic tropes as it still shows some clichés and predictable elements.
            
                In conclusion, &quot;Flipped,&quot; directed by Rob Reiner, offers a nostalgic and heartfelt coming-of-age story that goes beyond typical romantic tropes. Through its exploration of techniques such as dual perspectives, the film captures character growth and the innocence of first love. While the cinematography highlights the charm of the 1960s suburban setting and the movie delivers a wholesome narrative about love, family dynamics, art, and life lessons, it is not without its imperfections. The film's occasional predictability, pacing issues, and a noticeable bias towards its target audience collectively impact audience engagement. However, despite these flaws, the movie remains a relatable and authentic portrayal of first love, personal growth, and the complexities of human connection, making it a worthwhile cinematic experience.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>Tim Burton's Corpse Bride</b></div>
                Tim Burton's visually stunning story &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; is about love lost. Two color palettes are created in the movie: the brighter, more vibrant world of the dead and the muted, drab world of the living. The hero learns that his pets go to the same place as him when they pass away. Scraps, Victor Van Dort's childhood dog, greets him. He is all bones, but he is not a flea. Love, grief, and the value of accepting life's darker aspects are among the themes that are explored in the movie. Johnny Depp's character Victor Van Dort plays in a film that showcases the newest animation style. In the beginning of the film, Victor's parents and the Everglots are set up for marriage. Despite never having met before, Victor and Victoria end up falling in love. But Victor is a bashful person who finds it difficult to commit his marriage vow to memory. He puts the wedding band on the corpse bride Emily's withered finger as her arm reaches upward from the tomb. As per the regulations of the netherworld, this marriage is valid. Victor goes to a wedding reception where cheerful skeletons dance and sing to a Danny Elfman composition, and the wedding cake, which is composed of bones, looks delicious. Victoria is not to blame for her parents' heartbreak because she is an innocent young woman getting married to Barkis Bittern, a Victorian villain. Even though one of the three young people is dead, it is unfair that the other two should be happy while the other three are unhappy. Little grace touches and humorous details abound in the frame, as Tim Burton, who is renowned for them, skillfully executes them.

                Corpse Bride, a visually stunning film directed by Burt Burton, charmingly depicts the complex menace and love struggles in worlds of complex menace. All things considered, Burton's animation style does a good job of capturing the eerie and magical elements of his works. It's difficult to pinpoint the unsettling, otherworldly, magical quality that was created when stop-frame animation and live action were combined to create the well-known creature King Kong in an optical printer. The artificiality in movies like &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; and &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; gives them a strange, magical quality.
                
                The goal of the film is to make Emily seem like a likable character who remembers her horrible murder and wants to be a good wife to Victor. With her large eyes and full lips, the character exudes a spectral, seductive beauty. The film honors Ray Harryhausen, who elevated stop-motion animation to a fine art form. The significance of tabletop animation in the past is emphasized in the film.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>The Barbie Movie</b></div>
                The Barbie film, enticing audiences with the prospect of an artistically vibrant and captivating universe, invites viewers into a cinematic realm teeming with animated wonders. The film's aesthetic brilliance, characterized by a dazzling array of colors, intricately designed animation, and a lively ensemble of characters, crafts an immersive experience that undeniably captures the attention of its primary audience—children. However, as one delves into the substance of the narrative, the initial allure of the film gradually diminishes, exposing a storyline that lacks the depth and innovation necessary for a truly compelling cinematic journey.

                At the heart of the film's narrative critique lies its reliance on formulaic story arcs commonly associated with animated films for children. The plot unfolds predictably, adhering to well-worn paths that fail to offer surprises or engage the audience beyond a superficial level. Opportunities to explore more sophisticated themes or deliver a narrative with broader demographic appeal appear overlooked in favor of adhering to established animated tropes. While familiarity may provide comfort, it also poses the risk of rendering the storyline forgettable, particularly for adult viewers seeking a more enriching and layered cinematic experience.
                
                The film's dialogue, a pivotal component bridging the fantastical world of the film and the emotional connection with the audience, presents another area with room for improvement. Clichéd exchanges lack the wit and cleverness that could elevate the dialogue beyond the confines of children's entertainment. The absence of nuanced language diminishes the potential for cross-generational appeal, missing an opportunity to infuse the narrative with humor and depth resonating with both young and mature audiences. A more sophisticated approach to dialogue could have added layers to the characters and elevated the film to a level where it becomes a memorable and enjoyable experience for viewers of all ages.
                
                Character development emerges as a significant challenge in the Barbie movie, where visually dynamic characters often fall short in terms of depth. While their vibrant appearances capture the eye, the narrative fails to provide these characters with the necessary arcs and complexities that would foster a genuine emotional connection with the audience. The protagonists, though visually appealing, remain largely one-dimensional, preventing the audience from fully investing in their journeys and experiences. This lack of character depth represents a missed opportunity to create a lasting impact, as well-developed characters are fundamental to the success of any narrative-driven film.
                
                Beyond the narrative and characters, the soundtrack, while catchy and suitable for its target demographic, appears underutilized in contributing to the overall viewing experience. Music possesses the transformative power to enhance storytelling, evoke emotions, and create memorable moments within a film. In the case of the Barbie movie, the soundtrack, while enjoyable, seems to play a supporting rather than a transformative role. A more strategic integration of music into key narrative moments could have heightened the emotional resonance of the film and left a lasting imprint on the audience.
                
                In essence, the Barbie movie, despite its visual splendor, appears to prioritize aesthetic appeal over substantive storytelling. While it succeeds in capturing the attention of its primary audience, especially younger viewers, its narrative choices and character development shortcomings hinder it from achieving a more universal and enduring appeal. By breaking free from the constraints of predictable storylines, incorporating more sophisticated dialogue, and investing in robust character development, the Barbie movie could have transcended its animated genre, establishing itself as a timeless classic capable of resonating with audiences across generations.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>The Woman King</b></div>
                &quot;The Woman King&quot; brilliantly weaves a tapestry of structural components, creating a multi-layered narrative to illustrate the complexity of an African monarchy in transition. The film adopts a mosaic-like storytelling style, weaving individual character arcs, cultural customs, and historical events together to produce a holistic representation of societal dynamics. The film follows Nanisca, a general in the Kingdom of Dahomey's all-female military army in the 18th century. The film investigates the power dynamics and societal factors that determine Nanisca's experiences and role within the kingdom through its narrative framework. Furthermore, we can get insights into the underlying meanings and social constructs depicted in &quot;The Woman King&quot; by evaluating the film's depiction of gender roles, language, and cultural standards.

                &quot;The Woman King's&quot; character structure is inextricably linked to the kingdom's societal hierarchy and cultural standards. The protagonist, a formidable female warrior, stands in defiance of existing systems, challenging traditional gender norms and societal expectations. Supporting characters, both allies and villains, influence and shape the protagonist's path, contributing to the film's investigation of power relations and the interconnectivity of individuals within the societal framework. The picture features a wide spectrum of individuals, each with their own set of motivations and problems. Nanisca, performed by an exceptional actress, is a powerful and resolute leader who questions established gender roles. Nanisca's relationship with her daughter, Nawi, provides complexity to the story by highlighting the intergenerational problems that women endure in a patriarchal society. The structuralist perspective enables us to comprehend how these individuals interact within the film's larger social and political setting.

                &quot;The Woman King&quot; has a linear narrative format that follows Nanisca, the leader of the Dahomey Amazons, as she confronts French colonial soldiers. The film follows a cause-and-effect structure, focusing on the battle between the Dahomey people and their oppressors. This structural approach effectively communicates the struggle for liberation while also emphasizing the tenacity of the female warriors. It delves into subjects such as power, resistance, and gender roles. We can study how these concepts are expressed and reinforced throughout the film via the lens of structuralism.

                The film's structural elements are visually portrayed through careful attention to detail in photography and set design. Intimate close-ups highlight the characters' emotional depth and societal difficulties, while wide-angle images depict the grandeur of the African terrain. The visual narrative is enriched by costume design and set details that reinforce structural depictions of social hierarchies, cultural rites, and the conflict between tradition and modernity. From a structuralist standpoint, language and communication patterns are also important features in &quot;The Woman King.&quot; The film depicts how language is used to reinforce or challenge power dynamics inside the country. The characters' talks and exchanges illustrate the power of words in forming views, relationships, and societal hierarchy. We can learn about the underlying principles that control social relationships by evaluating the linguistic choices and communication patterns represented in the film.

                &quot;The Woman King's&quot; narrative flow is non-linear, carefully exposing past and present events to highlight the interdependence of characters and historical conditions. Symbolism is important in &quot;The Woman King&quot; because it conveys deeper meanings and reflects societal institutions. Weapons, traditional clothes, and rituals are used in the film to express power, honor, and cultural identity. These symbols serve as signifiers, with important cultural and social significance. We can acquire insights into the underlying systems that drive the characters' behaviors, goals, and connections within the kingdom by dissecting these symbols. This structural strategy broadens the audience's awareness of the complex social fabric while allowing thematic ideas to reappear throughout the film. Symbolism, such as repeating motifs or visual cues, serves as structural signifiers, enhancing the meaning of scenes and contributing to the film's coherent structural structure.

                In conclusion, &quot;The Woman King&quot; provides a compelling examination of societal institutions through a structuralist viewpoint. The film questions conventional gender norms, investigates language as a weapon for power dynamics, and uses symbolism to reveal deeper meanings. The Dahomey Amazons' hierarchical organization reflects power relations within society, while resistance to colonization underlines the quest for freedom. Furthermore, the film subverts conventional expectations by showing women as ferocious fighters, challenging established gender standards. We acquire a better grasp of how societal systems impact the experiences and identities of individuals in &quot;The Woman King&quot; by evaluating its narrative structure, portrayal of gender roles, language usage, and symbolism.

                &quot;Me Before You,&quot; directed by Thea Sharrock in 2016, tells a touching love story between Louisa Clark (Emilia Clarke) and Will Traynor (Sam Claflin). The film explores themes of love, sacrifice, and independence as the characters face life's challenges. However, despite its heartwarming feel, the movie has faced criticism for how it portrays disability and the ethical choices made by the characters.

                The film does well in portraying the emotional journey of Louisa and Will's relationship. Emilia Clarke's performance is outstanding, bringing vulnerability and charm to Louisa. The on-screen chemistry with Sam Claflin adds to the emotional impact. Yet, the film has been criticized for reinforcing stereotypes about disability, with concerns that Will's character, a quadriplegic, is sometimes reduced to a mere plot device.
                
                Despite its emotional depth, &quot;Me Before You&quot; has been criticized for oversimplifying complex issues around assisted suicide. Some argue that the portrayal of Will's decision to end his life may send a troubling message about the value of life with a disability. A more nuanced exploration of these ethical dilemmas could have benefited the film, avoiding potential harm to viewers facing similar struggles.
                
                Additionally, the film's pacing and narrative structure are seen as uneven. While the central love story is well-developed, certain subplots and supporting characters feel underexplored. Rushed storylines may hinder the audience's engagement with the characters' emotional landscape. The film's reliance on romantic tropes could make it predictable for seasoned genre viewers. A deeper exploration of supporting characters and more nuanced dynamics could have elevated the film beyond its conventional romantic drama framework.
                
                In conclusion, &quot;Me Before You&quot; delivers a touching love story that resonates emotionally. The chemistry between the lead actors and Thea Sharrock's direction contribute to its undeniable appeal. However, the film's treatment of disability and the ethical questions around assisted suicide warrant careful consideration. While successful in evoking empathy, the film falls short in addressing the complexity of the issues it touches upon. Ultimately, &quot;Me Before You&quot; tugs at the heartstrings but leaves room for improvement in its portrayal of disability and the ethical considerations surrounding life-altering decisions.

            A film based from a 2016 award winning (Women’s Fiction) romance novel by Jojo Moyes published on January 5, 2012. A story about the people who struggles the ideal condition of ones life. The life of a person who is suffering from a disability. It begins with a girl Louisa Clark who lose a series jobs then one day, she was given an opportunity to apply as a private carer of a disable man. As she began her work, she asked herself if will she be able to survive with her new job.

            Will Traynor, the disabled man who Louisa Clark is taking care of. Will is a man who is not easy to talk to, unreachable, and does not know how to communicate with other people which made her job more challenging and hard. But with Louisa Clark’s  cheerful and quirky attitude, Will become more open and they start to communicate better. Louisa overheard an argument between Will’s parent with his decision to go Dignitas in Switzerland for assisted suicide. Then Louisa had a chat with Will’s parents and gave her the chance to convince Will for six months to change his mind.

            As they spend time together for the past six months to convince Will to change his decision, Louisa organized a trip and adventure to show him the things he will miss, what life has to offer, and the people worth living for. Because of the time they spend together, Louisa’s boyfriend, Patrick got jealous and split up with Louisa afterwards. A few days later, they were invited to a wedding. They start to fall in love but, it never changed Will’s decision. His decision about his assisted suicide broke Louisa’s heart which made her quit her job and refuse to contact him.

            However, “Me Before You” has faced criticism for its handling of sensitive themes, particularly around disability and assisted suicide. Some viewers and critics argue that the film oversimplifies these issues and inadvertently promotes harmful stereotypes about people with disabilities. The narrative’s conclusion, in particular, has been a point of contention, sparking debates about its ethical implications. And with its cinematography and soundtrack, it made the movie more heartfelt and emotional. Also, the countryside setting and well curated music selection added a stronger impact to the audience.

            In summary, “Me Before You” is a tearjerker that succeeds in telling a heartfelt love story, bolstered by strong performances. Nevertheless, its approach to complex themes has generated mixed reactions, making it a film that resonates differently with different audiences. It leaves the the audience the feeling of appreciating the things they have in life. And made them realize that some things does not go as they planned. This duality makes “Me Before You” a significant film, both for its storytelling achievements and for the discussions it has sparked in its audience.

    <div style='text-align: center;'><b>Enola Holmes</b></div>
    &quot;Enola Holmes&quot; centers on the vivacious and talented younger sibling of Sherlock Holmes, the world-famous investigator. Enola learns that her mother Eudoria Holmes has vanished on her sixteenth birthday. She defies Victorian England's social mores and uncovers a sinister plot while setting out on a quest to locate her. She then encounters Lord Tewkesbury, a Viscount on the run who is also trying to escape his own problems, along the way. Together, they make discoveries through a world full of tricky opponents and mysterious clues. Enola is an intriguing and interesting investigator because of her cunning, ingenuity, and rejection of normal gender norms. A new, dynamic protagonist is introduced to the genre, and the film pays respect to the history of Sherlock Holmes while skillfully fusing aspects of ambiguity, excitement, and humor into a gripping tale.

    In &quot;Enola Holmes,&quot; the developing romance between Viscount Tewkesbury and Enola Holmes makes for an engaging side story. Tewkesbury is first seen as a Viscount on the run from the confines of his aristocratic existence, but during Enola's search, he becomes mixed up with her. They have a companionship, mutual support, and developing affectionate dynamic. Tewkesbury gains support from Enola's humor and ingenuity as she overcomes obstacles, and he in turn becomes a friend on her path to self-discovery. Their relationship goes beyond what society expects, demonstrating a partnership built on equality and common values and giving the movie a touch of tenderness. Meanwhile, because of her unusual upbringing, Enola and her brother Sherlock have a strained relationship at first, but with time, a sincere appreciation for her brilliance grows. Their changing dynamic offers a moving examination of the conflict between custom and the need for individual freedom, finally exposing a familial tie that transcends their differences. Lastly, through supporting Enola's pursuit of justice and her steadfast adherence to her values, Eudoria's impact on her endures throughout the movie, adding to the overall themes of breaking tradition and paving one's own route in a culture that frequently opposes advancement.

    The socioeconomic and class components of Victorian England are the main subjects of Enola Holmes' writings. Enola's contempt for the demands society placed on her as an upper-class lady is depicted in the movie, which also hits on the inflexible class systems prevalent at the period. One may argue that her rejection of the gender norms and quest for independence represent a threat to the status norm. The movie also features working-class folks and highlights the difficulties they encounter. Enola's persona, however, goes against what was expected of women in the 19th century. Her self-reliance and ability prove to be invaluable assets as she navigates a society dominated by men. In the film, authority, freedom, and the restrictions imposed on women in the Victorian era are discussed. The travels of Enola and her contacts with other female characters—such as the suffragist Edith and her mother Eudoria—help to tell a feminist story that emphasizes the value of women's voices and decisions.

    Moreover, the film made use of flashbacks, the order of events, and how each of them adds to the story's ultimate significance. It searches for patterns and symbols that appear repeatedly and have significance throughout the story. Symbols in &quot;Enola Holmes,&quot; such as ciphers, disguises, codes, puzzles and floral language, may be examined for their recurrent meaning and their role in the overall composition of the movie. Using period-appropriate photography and production design, the movie captures the mood of Victorian England. The movie's soundtrack heightens the emotional tone and goes well with the Victorian ambiance.

    In conclusion, the thrilling and inspiring, &quot;Enola Holmes&quot; is a film that draws audiences in with its excellent story, acting, and concept. Millie Bobby Brown's interpretation of the vivacious Enola, which showcases both the character's determination and her acting skills. The film is more immersive because of its careful attention to period-appropriate visuals and production design. I heartily suggest this film to anybody looking for an exciting story with a strong female lead, lots of twists and turns, and insightful perspectives on equality and feminism.

<div style='text-align: center;'><b>&quot;2037&quot;</b></div>
    The movie &quot;2037&quot; resonates deeply with me as a teenager navigating fears and uncertainties about the world beyond my comfort zone. This Korean film evoked profound emotions within me, shedding light on the pressing issues that plague our contemporary society. The poignant portrayal of the unbreakable bond between a mother and daughter deeply moved me, drawing parallels to my own experience with a remarkably loving and supportive mother. The raw depiction of rape and a teenager coming to terms with an unexpected pregnancy evoked strong emotions, while the unexpected friendship formed in jail and the heart-wrenching conclusion left a lasting impact in me.

    One of the top things that made me choose this movie out of all the movies I ever watched is its heart wrenching movies that I badly want to avoid because it affects me so much and I know it will stay with me for so long, I felt the pain, the sadness, the unfairness and the heartbreaking tragedies that a 19 years old had ever experienced. I’m not sure what to feel about the fact that a 19 years old had to go through with this situation when she’s a sweet, loving, and caring child to her mother who is a deaf person with asthma. She learned how to speak because of her daughter who keeps pushing her to learn. As I witnessed her mother carrying the box of pizza and and wandering barefoot, my heart was wrecked, she really want to see to herself that her daughter is fine and she’s doing fine inside the jail.

    This movie successfully conveyed its messages. The reality of our life, how law usually works regardless and based of the circumstances, and how dicult it is for the victims to continue their life haunted by the tragedy that happened to them. Also, the life inside of the prison, that every characters in this movie managed to execute really well and bring the story come to alive. Both the mother and daughter gave me a severe trauma as I experience a normal life, it gave me the anxiety that maybe one day something might happen to me without warning, and it can really change our normal life. Same as the Main Character’s situation where she was living the best of her life, her life was peaceful and filled with happiness not until a one evil deed could change her life entirely.

    The Main Characters braveness to overcome the pain she had to go through is one of the highlights that I’m always impressed. Accepting herself and opening up with other people that lead to a creation of a family inside the jail. The Main Character symbolizes the unspoken reality of this generation, a reality that everyone should be aware about. The discrimination of those people with disability and a reality that its not everyone who makes ‘good deeds’ will only receive good things in this world but instead, a harsh reality will really slap you and will lead you to question why do we experience it when we did not even hurt nor kill anyone.

    The film ended with sadness as the Main Character died with her baby inside her womb. The relationship between a deaf mother and her daughter has been shown very well. It may seem a bit cold but I think it's because the Main Character’s life was not easy. She felt she had to look after her mother, so she decided to lie that she didn't drop out of school and she worked a lot. But she was still happy and wanted to fight for herself by passing the government exam. She and her mother cared for each other but sadly in the end, her mother was left alone. It was really a silent pain that I felt inside my heart as I watch her mother smiled while she’s ironing her daughter’s formal attire for her upcoming interview then showed for the last time the Main Character’s ‘2x2’ picture wearing her very beautiful bright smile.

    The movie &quot;2037&quot; skillfully portrays a poignant narrative of heartbreak, while simultaneously highlighting the profound kindness inherent in female friendships. The movie adeptly delivers messages of hope and healing, addressing significant social issues. I have learned from this movie that we shouldn’t trust even the person we’ve known for a long time because sometimes they are the one who can harm to you. Lastly, for this movie, Nothing can equal the Mother-Daughters Love, this is the best love of all time.

<div style='text-align: center;'><b>The Thread of Gold: &quot;Luck&quot; (2023)</b></div>
    In the intricate tapestry of life, luck acts as the volatile thread weaving together moments of serendipity—such as chancing upon a penny on the pavement—or moments of adversity—like the longing for a &quot;forever family&quot; within the confines of an orphanage, yet to no avail. This thread can either be adorned with the brilliance of gold or doused in the darkness of ebony, embodying good and ill fortune, respectively. Luck wields a profound influence over the elaborate patterns of our circumstances, mirroring the story of Sam Greenfield in the 2022 animated film &quot;Luck,&quot; a production by Skydance Animation. As I immersed myself in this cinematic journey, a whirlwind of emotions swept through my mind, eliciting both laughter and tears. Numerous scenes of the film resonated deeply with my own life, amplifying the overall impact of my viewing experience. In my perspective, this film is of considerable merit, capable of bestowing meaningful insights upon its audience. It encourages the acceptance of life's unpredictable events, even those seemingly unfortunate, insinuating that these occurrences could ultimately lead to meaningful encounters—a theme poignantly emphasized in the movie's concluding narration. &quot;Luck&quot; unfolds as a heartfelt film filled with evocative occurrences, serving as a gentle nudge that the unpleasant things we encounter do not necessarily define the beauty of our lives.

    The story centers around 18-year-old Sam Greenfield (voiced by Eva Noblezada), whose life has been consistently marked by misfortune. Growing up in the Summerland Home for Girls orphanage, Sam has never experienced the joy of finding her &quot;forever family&quot;—the adoptive family that would be her lifelong companion. Everything changes one fateful day when she crosses paths with a black cat named Bob (voiced by Simon Pegg). Suddenly, Sam's luck takes a positive turn after picking up a penny from the pavement where she and Bob met. However, as she loses the penny, her fortune reverts to its previous unfortunate state. Hence, Sam follows Bob, believing the latter was the reason for her good luck. This leads her to the magical Land of Luck, the origin of all luck on Earth, both good and bad. From this point in the film onwards, Sam embarks on a quest to reclaim the luck she briefly experienced. Interestingly, her motivation is not self-centered; instead, Sam seeks to regain the tangible form of luck to help her younger friend in the orphanage, Hazel (voiced by Adelynn Spoon), in finding her own &quot;forever family.&quot; However, as Sam navigates through this mission, a series of accidents and circumstances unfold, escalating into dire occurrences that pose a threat to the very existence of the Land of Luck. Nevertheless, owing to her faults, Sam finds a way to fix the major conflict, and with her unwavering resolve, she successfully puts everything back in order. After which, she brought unity among everyone and exchanged meaningful dialogue with the other characters, most especially with Bob.

    In the film's introductory scenes, I found myself intrigued by Sam’s behavior toward the series of unfortunate events that continuously unfolded in her life. This prompted me to contemplate moments in my own life when things veered off course, and how I reacted in the face of them. In addition, witnessing Sam's persistent struggles also led me to a newfound appreciation for the fact that I do not go through such misfortune as frequently as she did. The introduction evoked a sense of empathy as I considered that, despite being of the same age as me, Sam has already grappled with a myriad of misfortunes. Yet, she resiliently continued living her life on her own terms. This realization left me in awe of Sam's character and ignited a desire within me to emulate her strength and perseverance.

    Entering the rising action of the film, I found myself deeply engrossed in the unfolding connection between Bob and Sam. As a cat lover, the moment where Sam extended a kind gesture towards Bob struck a chord of joy within me. This particular segment of the film stirred my emotions as it is filled with meaning, and I envisioned sharing a similar moment of compassion if faced with the same situation. In addition to this, the resolution of Sam's conflict—her fervent pursuit of Bob to recover the lucky penny that had been lost—highlighted her benevolent nature. What sincerely struck me was the selfless motivation behind her persistent effort. Sam's chase was not driven by personal gain; instead, it stemmed from her wish for Hazel–her younger friend in the orphanage—to be blessed with good fortune and find her &ldquo;forever family.&rdquo; Witnessing this level of selflessness emphasized the value of altruism for me. The spectacle of someone working diligently for the benefit of others was genuinely uplifting. It is a compelling motivation for me to aspire towards embodying benevolence, wherein I consider the happiness of others and extend beyond a singular focus on personal satisfaction.

    During the film's climax, I found myself deeply immersed as the events in the Land of Luck intensified. The atmosphere and tone were charged with tension, keeping me on the edge of my seat. Despite the numerous challenges that stood in her way, Sam was able to successfully address the dire circumstances within the foreign realm. This aspect of her character earned my commendation as it showcased her ability to think critically under pressure—a valuable skill applicable to daily decision-making. What stood out even more was Sam's mature response to her own mistakes. Instead of evading accountability, she chose to take ownership, displaying a level of liability akin to that of a full-grown adult even though she had only turned 18 years old. This exemplary behavior deserves recognition and served as an inspiration for me to shape my attitude in a similar conscientious manner. It prompted an aspiration to acknowledge my shortcomings and take responsibility for my own wrongdoings against another.

    In the film’s falling action, my joy was unveiled extensively as the other characters not only recognized but also celebrated Sam's earnest efforts to resolve the predicament. A profound sense of unity permeated the vast expanse of the Land of Luck, leaving me in a state of poignant admiration. Seeing individuals coming together in perfect harmony was a beautiful spectacle, especially for someone who values the preservation of peace. In my perspective, this segment—unfolding after the arduous struggles of everyone involved—characterized the most exquisite display of unity. Subsequently, as the denouement unfolded, I was filled with warmth when Bob, with his distinct feline personality, had grown closer to Sam, signifying a level of trust he had placed on the latter. The emotional resonance was further heightened by witnessing the deepening connection between Bob and Sam–when they became each other’s &ldquo;forever family&rdquo;. This profoundly touched me, drawing parallels to my experiences with the eight cats I own—knowing how challenging it can be to earn their trust yet acknowledging how meaningful it is when we consider each other as family. In the bigger picture, the evolving relationship between Bob and Sam served as a powerful reminder that time has the remarkable ability to carve beautiful connections among individuals. This kindled self-reflection, inspiring the realization that similar meaningful relationships could manifest in my life as long as my intentions remain sincere and genuine with the people I constantly interact with every day.

    Considering all the literary elements at play, I find this movie utterly captivating and delightful. It resonates with me on multiple levels, significantly enhancing my overall enjoyment and viewing experience. Beyond its compelling narrative, I appreciate the film's meticulous attention to artistry, cinematography, soundtrack, and storyline. These elements are crafted with diligence, and in a manner that can effectively deliver the movie's moral lesson while simultaneously providing entertainment to the audience. Moreover, the movie evokes a sense of both sentimentality and whimsy in me, seemingly transporting me back to the carefree days of my childhood with the innocent urge to befriend fantastical beings. By scrutinizing both technical and artistic aspects, &quot;Luck&quot; follows a heartening cinematic journey that seamlessly blends meaningful themes with entertainment, keeping things interesting throughout the entirety of the film.

    This animated film has garnered positive responses from both audiences and critics alike. Green, in particular, praises the movie for its adept balance of preserving a charming innocence while seamlessly incorporating sophisticated ideas and characters that resonate with a more mature audience. In addition, a reputable organization describes &quot;Luck&quot; as a visually captivating experience, enriched with enjoyable and action-packed moments, all enhanced by a stellar cast. According to them, beyond its entertainment value, the film goes deeper, exploring significant themes like suffering and adoption. These profound subjects are presented in a relatable and memorable manner, specifically tailored for the intended audience of children and families. Aguilar echoes similar sentiments, emphasizing the visual appeal and enjoyable moments, coupled with the film's exploration of meaningful themes like suffering and adoption. Finally, Blackaby describes &quot;Luck&quot; as possessing an irresistibly uplifting storyline and a powerful message that highlights the significance of adoption and the transformative influence of perspective. This narrative prowess secures the film's place among the top animated releases of the year. Despite being one of Skydance Animation's early works, &quot;Luck&quot; has left a lasting impact on its audience through its creative and skillful delivery of the aforementioned meaningful themes.

    In conclusion, the film, &quot;Luck,&quot; not only provides entertainment but also delves into two major themes, adding to the list of reasons that explain why it is worth watching. Firstly, it explores the profound impact of our responses to both good and bad luck. It suggests that the manner in which we navigate and share our good fortune can amplify positivity as we spread joy and hope to more people. On the other hand, when confronted with misfortune, the movie encourages the audience to resiliently pivot, urging us to glean lessons from unfortunate circumstances and adjust their strategies to effectively conquer challenges. Indeed, the film affirms that confronting and overcoming difficult days is instrumental in personal growth, as trials and challenges contribute to the development of character and resilience. Secondly, the movie insinuates that the concept of family extends beyond blood relations or adoption documents. This relationship can be created through the connections we forge with other people, and can, therefore, encompass individuals who steadfastly support and love us unconditionally. Within the intricate tapestry of Sam's life, one single thread of gold ties her to Bob, her &ldquo;forever family&rdquo; that will endure throughout both of their lifetimes.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>Okja</b></div>

                Science fiction, fantasy, adventure, and a dash of social commentary are all expertly blended in the thought-provoking film Okja. The meat industry's ethical complexities are deeply explored in the main narrative, which also looks at the wide-ranging effects of corporate greed on contemporary society and the dynamic relationship between humans and animals. The film skillfully traverses ethical dilemmas, enthralling audiences with its captivating storytelling and profound message. Ahn Seo-Hyun, Tilda Swinton, and Paul Dano all deliver outstanding performances. Various aspects of the film Okja, including its story, performances, cinematography, and overall impact, will be politely critiqued throughout this essay.

                After seeing the movie, a young girl named Mija and her companion pig go on an adventure through the food industry that is full of moral dilemmas and corporate greed. The main character, Mija, sets out on a perilous quest to prevent Okja, her pig companion, from being exploited by the multinational company Mirando, which created her. The film's themes are industrialized food production, animal rights, and the moral dilemmas that arise in a society that prioritizes profit. The film invites reflection on the complex relationship between people, animals, and the environment with its poignant moments and striking cinematography. Its breathtaking scenery, which combines sterile industrial facilities with tranquil natural settings, effectively highlights the film's important message through cinematography.
                
                It deftly weaves together a story with several levels that examines the conflict between business objectives and personal ethics. Mija's unwavering resolve to free Okja from the Mirando Corporation's grasp offers a moving critique of the disparity in power between large corporations and common people. The main theme of the movie, which is ethical responsibility in a world driven by profit, is highlighted by this struggle. The film's criticism of sectors that put profit ahead of morality is strengthened by the way the Mirando Corporation is portrayed as a parodied image of corporate greed and callousness. The movie asks viewers to consider their own societal values and how their purchasing decisions affect more significant ethical issues in the midst of this portrayal.
                
                The story of the film expertly combines its themes of adventure, drama, science fiction, and social commentary, delving into conversations about environmental preservation, animal rights, and the moral dilemmas associated with the commercialization of living things. “Okja” is a good movie, but it finds a balance between humor and intelligence. The story line about a girl and her pig is a little slow at times, trying too hard to be meaningful but falling short. The satire is poorly done, but the adventure element is fun if sometimes exaggerated. The creature effects are charming, but too much pig-chasing and over-the-top corporate hostility irritates the audience. The film, which is set against breathtaking Korean landscapes, alternates between eccentricity and darkness, but it somehow seems more appropriate for the small screen. Its predictable nature, which is apparent right away, takes away from the whole experience.
                
                Ultimately, &quot;Okja&quot; proves to be an engrossing blend of science fiction, fantasy, and social commentary. It deftly crafts a story that skillfully negotiates the moral ambiguities surrounding the meat business while closely examining the widespread effects of corporate greed on modern society and the complex relationship between humans and animals. Paul Dano, Tilda Swinton, and Ahn Seo-Hyun all give excellent performances that add to the film's impact. Several facets of “Okja,” including its story, performances, cinematography, and social impact, have been carefully examined in this essay. The film captures the conflict between ethical consumption and exploitation in profit-driven societies by contrasting touching scenes with bleak industrial backdrops. However, occasionally, its attempts to create a meaningful story are thwarted by exaggerated adventure elements and cliched plot points, taking away from an otherwise enjoyable cinematic experience.

                <div style='text-align: center;'><b>Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen</b></div>
                Since at this time, people judge from what they see and will not look into the full details. It is like being prejudiced is normal, that they judge other people so easily without knowing the whole story. For instance, people’s race, gender, social status or even religion. This book was chosen for review to understand that there are two sides of the story and we must not judge other people too easily if we don’t know the whole story. And we must not let our pride let other people misunderstand us. The book, Pride and Prejudice is written by Jane Austen consists of three volumes, and has 23, 19, and 19 chapters in each volume. The book describes the conflict between the high-spirited daughter of a country gentleman and a wealthy landowner. 

                The Pride and Prejudice movie is based on the same-titled book. The themes of the story are wealth, marriage, class, and self-awareness. It is located in the United Kingdom and features regency-era customs. Because the narrator is more knowledgeable about the story's background, events, and characters' motivations, innermost feelings and experiences than any one character is, the author employs an omniscient narration style. The narrative's principal artistic device is humor. The book is more appealing because of its intricate and distinctive structure. The novel goes into great detail because each character is introduced and described in great detail. 
                
                In the book, the Bennet family struggles financially, so both parents thought of their 5 daughters on how they should be married. The protagonist Elizabeth Bennet wanted to marry from love, but due to the pressure coming from her parents, she was asked to marry their distant cousin, who is close to Lady Catherine. Elizabeth and Jane Bennet are both  good-hearted women but they have realistic faults like judging another person without knowing them well enough. Unfortunately, the Bennet family was not as well-off as Mr. Darcy's and Mr. Bingley's. This is where a portion of the conflict began. The Bennet sisters fall in love with upper-class men despite their social standing preventing them from being a desirable couple. On the other hand, a struggling partner in a relationship would benefit by marrying into a wealthy family. 
                
                The main female character comes out as a witty and endearing person, so I feel bad for her. However, she often makes rash decisions that lead her to believe lies. She condemns Mr. Darcy, for instance, for attempting to keep her sister Jane and his friend Mr. Bingley apart after she turned him down for marriage because she thinks he is rude and conceited.  She later starts to understand that he is a nobleman.  Because of her virtues, she can overcome her class limits and escape the cunning society. The marriage of Charlotte, Elizabeth's closest friend, to Mr. Collins, the heir to Bennet's estate, sticks in my mind as an example of the sharp difference between the two friends: one pursues true love, while the other pursues assurance in money. 
                
                Pride and Prejudice is suggested reading for both adults and young people because it tackles current issues that have an impact on people of all ages. It relates narratives of morality, love, and social status in addition to family relationships. It is also especially fascinating to read today because it describes the habits, interests, and way of life of people who lived 200 years ago. The book is written in ancient English because it was written 200 years ago. At times, it was hard to follow the plot because of the strangely unrecognizable grammar. The vocabulary was very difficult. For that reason, I suggest using an e-book with a built-in dictionary when reading this book. Additionally, the book begins slowly, which may put off readers and make them give up on it quickly.
